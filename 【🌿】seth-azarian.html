Azari hadn’t been sure on the proposal. In fact, the email had been left on read for a few days, reaching out with one of those automated replies instead of; <span style="font-style:italic"> Thank you for your patience. This email is to let you know we received your message. </span> 

Of course the details of the message were rather vague, having this <span style="font-style:italic"> Mr. Lyr </span> be rather selective to his wording – giving some, but not all. <span style="font-style:italic"> Expensive, authentic, priceless </span> -- some of the few words used by the customers that used his services. But for Aurelius,  it was patchy. 

The one thing that stuck out was the location of the item he wished to retrieve. Sure it was somewhere familiar to the Lacinia’s, but a place that he couldn’t very well take his more novice of brothers. Even those expert divers of the large family were few, and Azari rather leave them to step in his shoes for awhile. 

Then why does he go, and <strong> only </strong> him? It wasn’t the customer himself, but the turbulent rough waters off the shore of Emerald isle of this entrapping archipelago. Though at times the water might be calm on the surface, a whole new story happened <span style="font-style:italic"> underneath. </span> Plus, the amount given wasn’t as much as some – businesses didn’t stay successful with pro-bono work either. Before he started his decline letter, a sudden proposition was discussed. 

The dangerous waters off the shore of <span style="font-style:italic"> Emerald</span> might bring in more business down the road. Like there’s nothing that the Lacinia family <span style="font-style:italic"> couldn’t </span> retrieve from the murky depths of the sea.

Try finding this place first of all. Emails had been sent back and fourth, a final acceptance of the daring task, and finally an address so Azarian can finally meet and finalize a few things. 

The land address even lacked, with a rather extensive description of long winding roads,  natural landmarks, and the last <span style="font-style:italic"> “ If you think you’ve gone too far, keep going, trust me you haven’t! </span> Just because he preferred the sea did not mean he couldn’t operate a vehicle – and like hell would he try his journey on foot. From the shores to the market, and then to the remote location found only by coordinates took about four hours.  The trip back would be much less with fewer stops and recalculations. 

Rental was still warm, engine roared to a stop as the key turned in the ignition. An older model, something without a roof, an off-roader as if they were in some sort of safari. Might as well be, Azarian forgot how thick the flora was, with the multiple noises of native fauna. Checking his mobile device one more time, staring at the coordinates to make sure, though he knew he was right. 

The  residence looked small, perhaps only because the siren was used to a much grander of abode.  The twisting vines running up aged darkened wood and brick combination.  It was cute, how the borders of windows seemed to be carved from branches, to windowsills with specific flowers to assist the cozy-like aesthetic. Cobblestones for a pathway, leading Azarian up to the old wood door with heavily accentuated hinges.

He peered at his brother's work. Seth sat across him. He was hunched over, with those large hands fiddling with small tweezers and delicate, spring and lock mechanisms. All of it connected to a sparrow sitting primly on the table, cozied up in a nest of clumped hay. One of its injured wings was spread out, allowing Seth to carefully attach the miniature splint. 

The bird chirruped in alarm once he cinched the device. Its feathers bristled up. 

"Shh, shh. Sorry, just a little more," Seth's voice crooned softly. He stopped, and laid a finger atop the sparrow's head, petting it. 

In quick response, the bird's little body relaxed, slumping back down in the indent she'd made in the hay. Seth then returned to affixing the miniature implement.

"How do you do that..." 

"Practice. Intuiting. Like I've told you," with that pause, tired hazel eyes flicked upwards, "If you paid any attention while being here. You still can, the ealdorman is kind. He'll teach you anything if you lend him an ear." 

Aurelius pulled away from the table. His back slammed on the cushioned banquette. In a petulant manner, he crossed his arms and huffed. 

He knew what his brother was getting at. They've had this argument several times. Where Seth had a slow, languid drawl to his voice, Aurelius had a snappy, Estuary cadence to his, hinting at the posh upbringing that contrasted his sibling's own. 

"And I <span style="font-style:italic">will</span> when I return. I don't intend to squander my time studying here. It's a simple errand. I go, make sure the job's done, then I come back." 

"Then you won't have any problem with me tagging along." 

"No in fact, I do have a problem with that." 

"And what would that be?" 

"I'm not a child. I don't need a fucking chaperone." 

"You need someone to carry your things." 

"I can do that on my own. That's what magic is *for*, so I don't have to do the menial drivel." 

"This is why you're so skinny. Lazy." 

"Resorting to insults now?"

His gaze went back down to focus on the resting bird in his care. So fragile, like his half-brother. He shook his head. "Can't trust you with a stranger. Let alone some random siren you met off the internet. What if he scams you?" 

"I. Have. This." 

Nothing incensed more than Seth's coddling. Aurelius banged his elbow on the table, rattling the plates of half-finished pancakes and muffins. Clenching his fist, his hand combusted into flames. The entirety of his eyes went sclera-white. Raven locks flew upwards, as if a gust of wind suddenly coursed through. Such a flashy, mana-burning display of wizardly was costly, especially with his poor health. But Aurelius wanted to show off some form of independence.

"Mhmm. I bet they can sock you in the face before you say a single syllable off your fancy spells." 

"I'd burn them to a crisp first." 

Sighing, Seth grabbed something that leant against their table. It was an elderberry staff, with twisted at the end to hold a magically-charged emerald. He casually flung his arm backwards. The staff clattered on the floor, and rolled away. Like being doused by water, Aurelius stared stunned as his fire was extinguished in a second. His hair billowed down into a tousled mess. 

Aurelius used it partly as a temporary conduit for his magic, as well as a walking stick. After the injury, he couldn't walk without a crutch.

"Go ahead. Get it, mister I-can-do-it-on-my-own." 

Aurelius grit his teeth. 

"You--!" 

Before they could pop off into another row, three knocks to the door interrupted him. 

"Well?" the younger man scoffed.

Seth set down his tools. However, he sat still and simply gave Aurelius a stern look. 

"I'm coming with." 

"Fine! Just get the door."

The door was only a quarter of the way open, keeping the rest of his house, and ostensibly Aurelius, from view.

"Hello. How may I help you?" he asked, pretending as if he didn't know who this stranger was, "Tourist? Lost your way? The village square is that-a way, fifty more miles."

Physical signs were only slightly visible with where to actually place his hands. His eyes would scan the man-made ornate door, then the windows,  hoping to get some sort of movement inside. It was dark enough right? The lights were on, whether they were candle stick or electricity – though, the siren didn’t see any sort of <span style="font-style:italic"> power lines </span> this remote. Another reason why to be on guard. The remoteness of location. And he chose to go alone. 

This was starting to become one of those slasher movies with over-the-top  gore. Only, Azari was certain he could hold his own, and at least last if not, be victorious. 

But that’s also his ego talking. He had no idea what kind of person <span style="font-style:italic"> Mr Lyr </span> was save for having a place way far <span style="font-style:italic"> off the beaten path. </span>

The time when Seth answered the door, Azari was caught in a trance down at his feet. It could be mistaken for the other’s feet, that suddenly came into view. It makes the siren snap his vision upwards, as if caught <span style="font-style:italic">red-handed. </span>  The element of surprise draws a dumbfounded expression with slightly agape mouth, and widened bright eyes. 

Then, quickly his expression softens, and his lips curve up into that customer-appreciating smile despite the first impression. When Azari wasn’t in his right frame of mind he knew deception quite well. In this case, it was blatantly obvious, especially with the comment that followed after an <span style="font-style:italic"> almost </span> genuine smile. Hard not to raise a brow, but with a poker face trained for decades now he was able to keep it at bay.

Instead there’s different tactics. 

“ But I appreciate the directions none-the-less, though I won’t be needing them.” A polite decline, and only seconds before  eyes trailed up the door as it trying to peer through the gap above this guy’s head.

Seth's smile grew wider. In the same vein of politeness, he had the brass balls to suggest the siren  come back another day. From here, out in the middle of nowhere, where it took an hour or more to get to the nearest roadway. 

"Unfortunately, he's incapacitated for the moment. I <span style="font-style:italic">insist</span> you stay the night at the village, they've got nice inns there. Goodbye–"

Seth was just about to shut the door in Azarian face.

<span style="font-style:italic">Thump.</span> A soft thud echoed behind him. A mere second passed. This was followed by a squall, wuthering an ominous wail. 

"I'm here! I'm bloody here!" Aurelius squawked.

Before Seth could react, he was yanked away by some invisible force. Holding onto the doorknob that suddenly swung wide open, he was taken along for the ride. Seth would've hit his back against the wall, but even that little detail was taken care of. His momentum stopped abruptly, before he could slam against the wall. He cast a bewildered look at Aurelius. 

There his brother was, sitting in a heap of a black morning coat that was one-too-many-sizes big on him, on the floor. Aurelius slid out to grab his staff. His eyes were scorched white hot again. While the outstretched arm pointed to the door, staff in hand, his free hand clawed open and directed aloft to Seth, trembling for a moment. A burst of power to force the door open, and another to quell  it from harming his elder brother. Bicker they might, but Aurelius knew control. That spoke a lot about his arcane mastery.

He broke the tension by dropping his arms. Aurelius' eyes turned back to their sharp green. The errant winds died down.

"Esteemed friend! Come in, come in!" he beckoned Azarian in with a repetitive curl of his fingers, "Don't mind my brother's rudeness. I expected you to come, it's a privilege to work with a Lacinia."

Not that he assumed the place would be reserved for just the two of them. Is that somewhat of a <span style="font-style:italic"> siren </span> mentality? While on the hunt, it’s always nice to keep focus on one delicious <span style="font-style:italic"> morsel </span> rather than the whole herd. Yes, Seth was not wrong at all, a siren through and through even if he had his fill and wouldn’t be needing anything for at least a while yet. 

Ah, so this is the correct abode, at least the bloke was kind enough to include that before he tried to slam the door in the siren’s face.  He could tell he wasn’t welcomed, it didn’t need to take any intelligence to lead on the fact. 

“ Ah-- I apologize to--”  In his professional retort, he was going to mention the accommodations wouldn’t be at all needed but alas, the <span style="font-style:italic"> tides </span> have turned in the form of invisible currents that easily knocked Seth literally on his ass. 

And then there was a voice in the back. Had it said help in any form, Azarian would immediately think this guy was some sort of serial killer, or kidnapper. 

The scene unfolding felt a bit much. Something you wouldn’t want to do in front of new company if you could help it, but finally resting eyes on who is assumed to be Mr. Lyr – well, Azari drew his own reasons why.  He wasn’t about to get in the way, taking a few steps back as precaution once the door fully swung open to the cottage in the heart of Wandering Oaks. Keeping some composure to not trigger his flight mode, yet eyes still widened in some form of shock to the dramatic scene. 

Then it was over in seconds. Wind that seemed to amplify the mood and the rather danger of Mr. Lyr died down, along with the malicious glare in his eyes.

Azarian knew sibling rivalry, he knew sibling fighting. Just look at how large the Lacinia family was – not everyone was left to the parents these days like the first cluster. Wanting to sigh, yet exchanging that with a bright smile, showing sharp teeth he couldn’t very well change – they were well kept at least, and tried to show sincerity as much as possible.  “ Not at all, not at all. I can understand the extra guarding, since your place is so remote.” 

There’s one last look towards Seth as he crossed the threshold to the place finally. Only <span style="font-style:italic"> slightly </span> worried he might have the door shut on him once again. “ Ah, well, I appreciate the kind compliment. We aren’t really much of the celebrity type.” They’re just doing their job. 

He takes his seat after reaching his hand out for a welcoming shake. “ I’m Azarian, as you would already know by the emails. Thank you for your patience, as typhoon season can be quite busy for us.” Little white lies here never really hurt anyone. It’s better than saying <span style="font-style:italic"> I wasn’t sure if we should take on your inquiry or not. </span> 

“ Mr. Lyr, as you know, I’ve come to touch base and discuss the details of the job you requested... since you weren’t too adamant about discussing it via email.”  Ah, he forgot his brief case in the truck.. oh well. “ I do know the location however, it’s quite a volatile area. What are you trying to recover?”

He seen, no *summoned*, worse. Then again, mages at his university came across a diverse array of people. So he was impassive.

The same couldn't be said for the distrusting older brother. Scowling, Seth rose up from the floor and gently closed the door after Azarian. 

He walked over and stood looming behind Azarian's seat. He cast a shadow over the siren, an oppressive air. Seth crossed his arms and gave Aurelius a pointed look.

Well, this was awkward. 

"You must be famished after the trip here," Aurelius said after withdrawing his hand. His palm pushed the basket of freshly baked bread over to Azarian's side of the table. He notably kept the stack of pancakes and syrup to himself, he was rather selfish when it came to that. There were jars of jam, jelly, and clotted cream lying around, the lids were wrapped in gingham and tied with tiny, sweet patchouli bouquets. Azari didn't know it, but the man lurking behind him made those. Some were left open from their nibbling earlier. Aurelius added, "Or maybe parched?" 

Aurelius stared up at Seth, he raised an eyebrow.

"I'll get the kettle," Seth grumbled under his breath, walking away to head into the kitchen.

For a moment, that left Aurelius, who sat across Azarian. He glanced over his shoulder, watching Seth disappear. 

The coast was clear. For now.

"Oh thank god. He never leaves me alone," Aurelius confided quietly, "Nevermind that. Let's talk shop." 

He fiddled with the leather messenger bag right beside him.

"I apologize not giving you much to go on in our emails. You see this is, ahm, a delicate matter," he paused to lay down a portfolio folder, he cleared the plates and mugs to make way for it, "As in, <span style="font-style:italic">'this is going to make me stinkin' rich and gain me enemies'</span> sort of thing. You get me? So, I'll ask you to sign a nondisclosure with me after I brief you on this. Sound fair?"

The rest of it was suggestive. Consumption of humanly -made foods was a normal occurrence during travel – but you really wouldn’t find him eating much of it at his own home. His species, if not all, well, you didn’t overly need to eat less of course it was time to sustain the body. Some people did know this, but most perhaps not so much? Everyone tended to just focus more on the <span style="font-style:italic"> sometimes</span> cannibalism, though in general, very, <strong> very </strong> savage diet. 

So, to the offer of nourishment, he’ll happily agree out of courtesy. 

Though as of right now, the hairs at the back of his neck stood on end by the one who shadowed him with clear, ill intent.  “ Tea will be just fine, thank you.” Not that he was a fan of hot foods, or really at all. 

It was a big breath of fresh air as the <span style="font-style:italic"> storm cloud </span>  moved off to play butler, leaving the two patrons to discuss.  Again, he wanted to crack a grin at the comment but kept himself entirely neutral.  Azari was seldom left along from his multiple siblings since the guy was a bit of a work- a – holic. And well, as part of the first cluster, he had a lot of extra duties to manage. 

While he listened he helped with the plates and mugs. Clearing his area enough to have the portfolio easily passed. There wasn’t much of a concrete understanding to a disclosure save for the disbelief expression as he nodded only <strong> after </strong> scanning the handed clipping.

It made so much sense now, the portfolio was placed in comfortably in his lap, hands flipping through the material. “ I understand now. This isn’t necessarily illegal, but I see why you want to keep this quiet. “ Illegal in a sense of disturbing some sort of ancient historical site. One, people who only knew about it lived somewhere within the archipelago, and two, if someone outside knew about it – well, they’d be stuck anyways.  The laws and rules within the area differed greatly in some areas. 

“ I don’t need a full, or any explanation as to why you need the item. As a..salvor, that isn’t my job. But, I can tell you it might be a more money than what you previously said you allotted.”  

The portfolio was placed back down on the table. Staying at the image of the map location, “ You see this here.. We call this the abyss of Rombel. The wild life tends to be ... much larger, sharper teeth, bigger appetite.” Azari was one of the few that’s been around in that area once or twice before – but nothing more.  “ It’s like isopod haven down there. “ Though isopods are quite docile, and prefer eating the <span style="font-style:italic"> already dead </span> or any sort of leftovers that fall to the bottom. 

" It's doable for sure, but again, it's a matter of coin. . .

He took his fork and idly cut up a small portion of his half-finished pancake. "Vast swathes of kelp forest and about hundreds of shipwrecks. However, I'm not sending you that deep into the trenches for this. The item I'm seeking is somewhere around here." 

Chewing on his food, Aurelius reached over to tap on another spot in the map, not too far off from where Azarian pointed out. It was much closer to the shores, which curved in the shape of a lagoon. Aptly, it was named after its local inhabitants. <span style="font-style:italic">Merrows Cove.</span>

"Now, this is mermaid territory. Not your typical calm ocean sort either. Merrows, to be specific. Some kelpies too. Very territorial. Hostile. Of course, I'll compensate you with more payment for this, given the potential peril I'm putting you through. 

Then his free hand slid over to palm at the plastic covered files. Sneaking a finger in, he retrieved one of the newspaper clippings out of its filmy case. Cut out and pasted neatly on a clean sheet of paper. They were a collage of various cases of disappearances, drownings, or bodies found within certain parts of the area. Fingers pinching the paper, Aurelius held it up to Azarian's view. 

"Look at the dates. Every ten years there seems to be some sort of a disturbance around the area. Been happening since the forties. Bodies start popping up every turn of the decade, then peace up until the next tenth. Now merrows may be a grumpy sort... But they don't generally go around with raving, murderous intentions without provocation, unlike... ahem. I digress."

He set the clippings down. "Wasn't until the eighties when a survey team caught a few of the bastards alive. They hightailed it out of there, apparently their testimony states the entire fucking cove was after them. And they all looked like this." 

He flicked the page again. This time, it showed a black and white photograph of a merrow strapped tight to a gurney. A diminutive man, or a teen, from the looks of it. It had hollowed cheeks and sunken, beady eyes. Dark spots and pockmarks littered its skin. On its tail part, were evident patches of scale falling off or severe mottling from fin rot. 

The most harrowing thing about it was its face. Lips peeled back in an unnatural, contorted way, showing rows of jagged angler-like spikes for teeth. The teeth outgrew its own maw, so there was no way it could even close its mouth. Disturbingly, there were remnants of its formerly closer-to-human teeth still holding on. They crammed in between the spaces, some appearing loose and on the verge of falling out. 

"At first they thought it was a mermaid disease, or a virus. But every study sees their population  recover miraculously after each tenth year. Investigations went on long enough that they passed it over to my university." Aurelius paused to take another bite. "Anthropological division thinks it's cultural. Doubt it, Verity sent researchers on the off years to interview the population. Generationally. Not one remembers ever being feral. They'll deny it. I think its something else." That <span style="font-style:italic">something else</span> clearly was related to the artifact Aurelius was seeking.

"Fortunately for you, we're going on an off year. So no rabies-addled mermaids will be coming for your throat."

What else could it really be. The sea in and around the archipelago was well known to the family of salvors, however, not all. Still, things would surprise the siren, and well, with each quake it tends to alter the geological of the ocean bed. 

The point was, Merrows Cove, though located on the map and known to the locals – wasn’t at all known to the one that currently stared at it.  It’s been honestly a bit since Azarian even stepped foot on Emerald Isle. In fact, had Aurelius mentioned something about Merrows Cove, the siren would have just gathered a crew together for a quick job without any regard. Only reason why he presented himself alone was under the assumption it was Rombel. 

Now the newspaper clippings were starting to make sense, and though he mentioned not needing any history lesson – was actually thankful the younger brother ignored and began to elaborate. A barely audible chuckle, followed with a shake of his head. Not out of spite to Aurelius, but Azarian’s own stupidity of potentially getting his brothers almost killed. 

But alas, like the nymph across from his stated – they aren’t far off from those who have murderous intentions without prov-- 

That was totally called for. Sirens weren’t the most well-liked a species, as told by the older brother who burnt holes through Azarian. 

“ Wow, I’m surprised this hasn’t become well-known knowledge throughout .. this is honestly the first time I’m reading about it.” Eyes only connected with Aurelius for a second before drifting back down to the clippings he pointed out. 
<img style="display:inline-flex;vertical-align:middle;width:25px;height:25px" title=":blank:" id=":blank:" src="../emojis/blank_1119673702993379348.png" alt=":blank:"></p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1197964706359562443"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Saturday, January 20, 2024 02:04:03 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1197964706359562443">02:04:03</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-29">The images caught were rather scary indeed. A time where it was complicated to try and make anything up in film.  Ugly, much like the hunger that crept up every so often in Azari’s throat.  Were they so sure it was merfolk and not their unpredictable cousin? The similarities were <span style="font-style:italic"> almost </span> uncanny. 

Azarian was so lost in the photo now pinched between index and thumb, Aurelius’s voice started to become more and more distant.  It wasn’t until he felt the nudge of a knee purposely invading his personal space did Azarian finally blink. “ And what off- year is it, until the next episodic ... event?” He just may have scooted himself closer to the wall, turning his attention to Seth after creating space between them. 

Why did the guy decide to sit right next to him anyways? It wasn’t as if the siren could easily take on two at once, nor did he really want to. As deceptive, and ferocious as sirens can be, they can also be lethargic. “ Not that I don’t mind the lack of rabid merfolk, I rather not have any miscalculations, or surprises.” Does this mean he accepts the crazy job?  

Placing the clipping back in the folder,  Azari leaned back against the soft cushion, turning his gaze, peering past the window that also trapped him in. “ To be fair, and quite honest with you Mr. Lyr.. I haven’t the slightest clue..--” 

He turned to the younger brother across from him, “ Whether or not to take the job on, but then on the flip side I’m also contemplating on bringing a crew for extra support.. and also, did you want to come as well?” He’s trying to remember bits and pieces of the email conversation. “Can you breathe underwater Mr. Lyr?”</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1197964758100488283"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Saturday, January 20, 2024 02:04:15 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1197964758100488283">02:04:15</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-30">|| <span title="Username: zephtre

Nevermind that he left a great deal of empty space on the other side. He kept on scooting, and scooting, until Azarian was forced to touch the wall. 

Across him, the jovial smile on Aurelius’ face disappeared. Seth simply gave an innocent shrug. 

Pleased, he laid the cups down, then he set the tea kettle down on a fabric coaster. The kettle was made of clear glass. Inside was an in-built infuser. Seth reached for a tea caddy on the table, flicking it open he grabbed a small bud of a wrinkled, dried up flower. Seth opened the kettle's infuser compartment, dropped it, and snapped it shut. 

He laid his palm atop it. A tinge of green glowed at his fingertips, speeding up the process. Inside the glass bubble, the tea flower rapidly unfurled into a bloom, youth invigorated its petals, as though it were freshly plucked. The tea was effervescent for brief moment. Seth took his hand off. The glow of his palm disappeared.

Aurelius sighed and shook his head lightly, then resumed where he left off. 

“Ahem. Anyway. To answer your question, no I can't breathe underwater. Can scarcely swim as it is..."

Seth may have kept silent, but the patter of tea being poured out filled the table. He was filling up all three cups. 

"I expected you to bring a crew onboard. But... I'll request it only for the boat. For the dive, it's better you go alone. Merrows are kind of, shall we say, closed off?" 

"Hates outsiders," Seth interjected dryly, setting the kettle down as he turned to glance at Azarian, "Probably hate sirens even more."

His tea turned from ochre to a milky beige. Seth meanwhile, kept adding rock sugar from a bowl into his sickeningly sweet cup. 

"Well, Verity did send a mermaid there once. Colleague of mine. Was doing her masteral on Fomhóraigh genealogy. You'd think they'd be nice to one of their own." 

"I think I heard about that. She wasn't from here, was she?" 

"Nope. They shredded her fins up." 

"So what makes you think they won't bully this guy too," Seth pointed a thumb out at Azari, he definitely sounded amused.

"They won't. Merrows might be an anomaly, but I doubt they'd start a fight with you," towards the end of his sentence, Aurelius shifted to address Azari directly. Merfolk were often cautious around sirens. He believed that inclination didn't change with merrows. "Besides, you're only interested in combing the reefs. Don't go near the territory, and you're golden." 

That seemed like an opportune time to segue into what he was looking for. Reaching over, he turned the page of his portfolio again. This time, the pictures were of higher quality. New, recently taken a few years back. There was a bit of a blur to it, no doubt from the nervous diver who all but wanted to leave after taking the pictures. 

"There's three spots at the reef I want you to comb through. Here, here and here," his fingernail tapped on the accompanying map printed beside it, where red ballpen marks encircled certain areas, "This third one is nearest to Rombel, the seamount dips here. I'm sure you're aware about the maelstroms. Regardless, be careful." 

Aurelius flicked to another page. 

"This is what you're looking for." 

This time, the picture was an intricate, wood-engraved drawing, with a short paragraph printed in old font.

Aurelius fell silent for a moment, he squinted. The text was upside down from his POV, but he remembered what it should decipher to.

"Ah, wailstone," he said seconds later, figuring out the words to translate that archaic gibberish, "We're looking for a sacred rock the Tuatha Dé lost centuries ago. I reckon it wouldn't look exactly as in the picture. Sedimentation and all." 

The stone was shaped like a solar disk. Its rays twisted in Celtic knots before tapering to shark points. In its center was a face sculpted into a haunting grimace. A wearied old man. Skin was carved to be as coarsely ridged as bark. His abundant beard, textured like leaves, branched out to the sunrays. The god-figure's antlers twisted up into the knots. As open as its wide-eyed stare, its mouth gaped open in a perpetual scream. 

Seth furrowed his eyebrows. 

Craning his neck over Azarian's shoulder, he peered down at the image. He didn't know jack squat about diving, marine biology, or any of that nerdy archaeological drivel his brother was spouting. But he could definitely tell this was a high budget enterprise. He took a sip out of his cup. It was a bittersweet mix--or atleast it would be, before he put all that sugar in. Chrysanthemum from the flower itself, and a couple of red dates, wolfberry, and other ground up spices to temper it.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1198258201481707621"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Saturday, January 20, 2024 21:30:17 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1198258201481707621">21:30:17</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-34">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e

A fly that honestly kept on bugging the heck out of the occupants, fearless from the fly swatter that could have been mere inches away. Though life size, kind in nature, and very very skeptical about the species that sat across from family.  

Did he know Azarian from a hole in the ground? Perhaps not. But the big brother’s behaviour towards him was not at all unique compared to other strangers.  <span style="font-style:italic"> Take caution, </span> no trusting a meat eater <strong> known </strong> to drag anything in the depths of the sea to eat. When was it time to feed? It could be <span style="font-style:italic"> anytime</span> and Azari wasn’t at all obligated to tell.   It wasn’t no one’s business – and besides, things had to be taken a little quieter now with the new sovereigns popping up. 

Feeling already cramped, never understanding why on land people were really only restricted by gravity, to being uncomfortable as this <span style="font-style:italic">big </span> brother childishly shimmed closer, and closer.  Soon he couldn’t get away from the wide spread of the Nymph’s sit, and he was forced to touch him <span style="font-style:italic"> thigh against thigh. </span> Thank the gods for the display of tea, otherwise the long pause would be awkward. 

As of right now he’s trying to politely find a way to interrupt the two speaking, while still soaking up the information.  “ Because regardless of how closed off, instinct always sets in.”  Besides, Sirens were considered one of the top apex predators, perhaps to even both sea and land... Azari could be very intimidating when he wanted to, especially in front of a crowd. 

The tea was left simply because it was way too hot for Azari to drink. He preferred things on the chilled side, though hands still carefully slid the cup on it’s coaster closer to him – yet still avoiding from damaging the documents.

<span style="font-style:italic"> The WÆLSTON </span> 

For something only known to exist in the short minutes he’s been here – the familiarity of it was uncanny.  Honestly, it could really be nothing at all. The sea changed drastically underwater every high tide at noon.  Well manicured fingers touched the photograph, running nail lightly across the side of <span style="font-style:italic"> it’s </span> face. 

“ Hang on, hang on please...” It was time to snap out of it. “ What makes you think it’s not already lets say.. guarded, or protected by the merrows?” Or wait a minute ... “ I apologize, actually, there’s no need to answer that. I already know the answer.” His hand waved in the air dismissively. 

“ For the matters of transportation. I didn’t come here with a boat, though, since our job is invoiced, I will have a boat by the morn.” Not that they could really tell by the lack of natural light.  “ In terms of price, normally this costs something around ten thousand, I have to say about fifteen with the dangers involved. And the fact you want a disclosure signed.” It’s not like the Lacinia’s sold information to begin with, but extra security, extra pay.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1198452287291543703"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, January 21, 2024 10:21:31 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1198452287291543703">10:21:31</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-37">|| <span title="Username: zephtre

He bit down on his lip, worrying the chapped skin with nibbles. Unseen, his uninjured leg shook, bouncing on his toes. 

“Khh,” Seth made a noise between a cough and a huff, amused to see his brother holding in the urge to infodump. Whenever Aurelius got the chance to talk about their favorite topics, the man would jabber on and on endlessly. Azarian had no idea how much time (and atenttion span) he saved. 

After taking a sip of tea, Aurelius continued. 

“Figures with the boat. The coast’s pretty far from here.” 

He set his cup down and pulled out a checkbook and an antique fountain pen—made of obsidian and filigreed gold. The fact that he casually pulled out those two items hinted at his true financial capability. He also pulled a sheet of crisp, rolled up parchment out.  

“Money’s not a problem. Fifteen is reasonable. A week’s limit of search ought to do it. If you come up empty-handed, I’m willing to pay extra for extensions.”

“I thought you get seasick easily?” Seth teased, grinning as he kept his gaze on Azarian, “Must be payment for swimming in his vomit.”

“S-Shut it,” his mortified brother stuttered, “Ignore him, I can handle it. Moving on!”

With a flick of his hand, those three items he took out floated midair. His parchment unfurled. And the fountain pen began magically writing up a contract, facing Azarian so he could read it right as it was written. Aurelius’ penmanship ran in elegant, loopy cursive. Ink was still glinting wet as it set in. 

“A precaution.”

The pen moved over to write on it next. It wrote down all the necessary details. Both documents had his signature down. With a last downward flick of his hand, all three floated down and slid over to Azarian, waiting for the siren to sign on the immaculately dotted lines. 

“I’m an Arcana-licensed mage. You can cash it my bank. You can’t see my seal, but it’s there, no worries about getting it verified. You can convert it to whatever currency you want,” Aurelius shrugged nonchalantly, “Sovereign, drachma, spintriae.”

Sovereigns were magi euphemism for crowns: the typical gold, silver, and other lessening metallurgical valued coins the majority of the island used. Drachmas were older currency, ones Seth and his people used in the boonies. Spintriae was the most elusive one… That was what mages exclusively used in the trade of magical objects and ingredients.

“Long as you finish the job, the contract will consume itself and I’ll pay you your due. This I bind. By my right as Arcanus blahlahblah, and with my seal,” Aurelius sighed exasperatedly, skipping the lengthy oath incantation. He paused to take the red glove off his right hand. Raising it up, a symbol appeared on the back of his palm. A triquetra, burning into his skin like a firebrand mark. A scorched black outline. 

The parchment on the table mimicked the symbol, in a much more vivid way. Something pressed up against it, the dips and impressions of a face, as though a person was trying to press up and escape from his paper prison. A ghostly breath blew on Azarian’s ear, only palpable to the siren. Ephemeral, however. The impressions faded away in a split second. Only to be followed by the thing’s fingertips pushing out to draw the triquetra.

It was impossible for anyone to be underneath, playing tricks on Azarian.

“Just sign and we’re done.” Aurelius dropped his hand to casually sip at his cup again. The  mark on his palm was gone, but the seal was embossed on the parchment. 

Seth crossed his arms and remained silent the entire time. Part of him was just anticipating to see what Azarian would do, while the other half contemplated about <span style="font-style:italic">actually doing something nice for once,</span> and warning off Azarian. There was crucial thing about his brother that might sway the siren to reconsider. Aurelius was all about contracting for a reason. 

“I’d go with the spintriae if I were you,” Seth whispered conspiratorially, “Heard the alkemikers sell a pretty strong scent blocker. Could help get that wet market smell off of ya.”

Nah. He decided to fuck with Azarian’s head instead.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1198663688790474793"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, January 22, 2024 00:21:33 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1198663688790474793">00:21:33</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-41">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e

This is no way meant his suitcase and the likes were completely soaked. The year was advanced and with the help of those wizards in their wizardly isle – Azari was able to transport things bone dry, and still be fully submerged. 

It could really happen to land animalia should he give it a shot. In fact, with the different gifts given to him by trait of his species and sub-species... well, it might be easy to whip something up. Not that he would ever give anyone the choice. The siren still wanted to get paid in the end, without the need to babysit more than he actually needed to. 

Should he have decided to charge a bit more then? There was nothing against any sort of the business. If you were rich, pay the rich people prices. If you were much less off, well, it wouldn’t be pro-bono work, but it wouldn’t break them either.  The greed in him wanted to interrupt, and mention the price was per day, but the moment was missed.

Azarian leaned back, given the sudden movement of items and well, making sure he wasn’t hit at all in the process. At least Seth wasn’t directly behind him, also pressing him against the ornate table. Only then maybe, just maybe, Azari would break from his usual composure into something a little more blunt. Speaking of, did he not learn his lesson when he answered the door in the first place? Nevermind the buzzing fly, what about the biting mosquito? Why not buzz around, land, and irritate under the skin?

Precious metals was always a favourite among the siren people. They held value throughout the world, and not just the archipelago of Pleonexia. Sure it might be a little outdated in some circumstances, though, they still were counted as currency throughout. Even the ancient civilizations that seemed to flourish around this section on the planet understood it’s value. 

What scared the siren a little was the cool display in front of him. It was as if he was being tricked in selling his soul. Fine prints were always read, and having a lawyer go over it for precaution – though this time he’s given no such luxury. He can’t very well look at the older brother to read his face, that guy was constantly smug, grinning foolishly only from the discomfort he’s causing the Lacinia. A hand would come up, as shoulder would to the <span style="font-style:italic"> imaginary </span> puff of air that  assaulted him. Trying his best to trick the mind, grabbing a piece of hair that would have been the culprit, and tucking it behind the ear in question. 

He listened to Seth then, but refused to wander his eyes from the parchment. Pen already in hand, hovering over the dotted line. 

“ Is he coming along with as well?” Came the question, the elephant in the room, the third person to this crowd. Perhaps they needed a comical relief, someone to shoot jokes and get shot down. Something to throw actual jabs and then utterly fail as they’re put in their place.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1198797533128962189"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, January 22, 2024 09:13:24 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1198797533128962189">09:13:24</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-44">|| <span title="Username: zephtre

What was the siren playing at, trying to get rid of him? 

“Don’t you have gardening to do or something?” Aurelius averted his gaze.

“I’m coming with,” Seth answered snappily, shutting down any doubt that he wasn’t squeezing himself into this. 

“Who’s gonna watch over your house? What about this guy?”

Aurelius snuck a finger under the chin of the injured sparrow, still huddled in his little box, snoozing away despite the noise. He gently scritched at the soft feathers. 

“I have someone who’ll watch over while I’m gone.” 

“Curse your good neighborly relations,” Aurelius remarked dryly.

An abrupt noise interrupted them. 

<span style="font-style:italic">Thump.</span>

Soft thuds. Like a knock. But that didn’t come from the door Azarian entered. Or any door for that matter. The sound was close in proximity. It came from right beside Azarian, on the side where the siren was forced to stay close to the window. 

Outside lay a calm, stolid night. No clouds obscured the moonlight, blanketing the surrounding forestry in silvery chiaroscuro. Seth’s nearby potager garden was seen in better light. That was thanks to a pair of antique, wrought-iron outdoor lamps jutting out from the walls outside. The wooden corbels supporting it curled like twisted branches, even bearing actual acanthus leaves. Its lamps hung down like fruit.

Upon closer inspection, those lamps were shaped more like birdhouses. One of them had its panel open. And amazingly, there sat a miniscule glowing pixie. Though engulfed in flame, one could still make out its body. Tiny legs dangled off the edge of its lamp-house, it’d been watching the men all this time.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1199036563867324477"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Tuesday, January 23, 2024 01:03:13 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1199036563867324477">01:03:13</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-46"><strong> </strong>
But now caught in the act, the pixie tensed up. Its body language was expressive enough on its own. Red-tinged damselfly wings shuddered up. The embers of its fiery body flickered. The fairy shook its head vigorously. 

<span style="font-style:italic">Thump thump,</span> the sound incessantly continued, much closer now. 

The pixie stretched its small arm out and pointed down. The noise didn’t come from it. Instead, it came from another creature. Wanting to hide again, it then whirled around into its enclave, its fire-light danced in its wake. After the tiny hands pulled the panel closed, the lamppost now looked like any other lamp would. 

<span style="font-style:italic">Thump thump thump.</span> 

Heavy and sonorous, the quicker paced thuds conveyed *impatience*. Anger, possibly. It was strong enough to make the window’s glass shudder in its frame. If Azarian glanced aside, he’d see the beast waiting…

It was a lop-eared rabbit. 

But that was no ordinary rabbit. It wore a small brown newsboy cap, and had a matching  leather bag strapped to its back. Its tawny body itself was just a little bigger than a fist. The bunny sat waiting on the spacious windowsill outside. It thumped its hind leg again and grunted in annoyance.

“Oh, must be the post,” Seth said without batting an eye, as if it were completely normal to have a rabbit hand-deliver (paw deliver?) letters. Reaching over, he unlatched a little door that was cut into the quartered windowpane, pulling it open to let the bunny in. But since Azarian was on that side, this further squished the siren against the wall.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1199036622050701312"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Tuesday, January 23, 2024 01:03:27 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1199036622050701312">01:03:27</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-47">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e

After all the nymph was doing. Breaking the boundaries of personal space, and making sure he damn well knew it. Relentless in his attacks, both physically and verbally. There wasn’t a minute that went by that Seth wouldn’t constantly remind Azarian that perhaps he didn’t belong here. 

So in the end, why wouldn’t he try to rid him from the expedition?  

“ Five thousand extra for your older brother. As both of you are considered liabilities to me while I do my job.”  It’s a no brainer. Usually the customers always stayed on land, far away from the extraction point since anything could happen. 

Five thousand was a little over exaggerated, but forgive the siren who was starting to become annoyed – though giving little impression of the thought. Five thousand to deal with what he’s currently dealing with since Seth gave no inclination he was going to lessen any time soon. 

It’s hard not to notice the life outside the window. Azari found himself turning more often than he anticipated, following the luminescence of objects, and well, the  life that inhabited Emerald isle. Then... 

<span style="font-style:italic"> thump, thump, thump </span> 

What now? Is this part of some master plan of the elder brother. A last resort to finally persuade the siren in cancelling the whole ordeal? The pen in his hand had struck the parchment, making a small mark as he felt his body lurch forward at the sudden breech.

“ Nn!” A groan escaped, only because the blasted table now pressed harshly into his abdomen. White hair fell over his shoulders, and onto the surface – some locks in the hot tea provided minutes earlier. He’s happy it was just that and not spilling the damn thing.  His free hand balled into a fist, bracing himself as Seth continued to do whatever he was doing – opening the little door in the windowpane?

And what was Aurelius doing? Laying in wait, while also lightly bickering with the one who legit pushed himself <span style="font-style:italic"> over </span> Azari. If not for his sake, he would assume this is just how the nymphs were. Unhinged, ill-mannered, and rather dopey.    

“ Excuse me,  I wish you would have told me, I could easily have gotten that for you.” For the first time during this whole meeting, Azari finally had enough nerve to forcefully push himself up, pressing his shoulder against Seth to hopefully push him <span style="font-style:italic"> back. </span>

At least enough to sit up straight again. 

“ Twenty, and we have a deal. I will sign this, and then we can be on our way within twelve hours. “ Enough time to have the boat brought over, enough time to pack and discuss strategy.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1200173681805111338"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Friday, January 26, 2024 04:21:43 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1200173681805111338">04:21:43</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-50">|| <span title="Username: zephtre

"Sorry. Was worried you'd eat my friend here," he said, pulling back from the window, <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> purposely nudging his shoulder back at Azari. Albeit with a little too much force, unintentionally or not. His bullheadness didn't back down one bit. Seth made no move to scoot back and give Azari some breathing space. He pointedly kept his bum still on the bench, depriving the siren of much needed legroom. And all while there was a comically large amount of unoccupied bench on the other side. A petulant scowl was directed at the siren. 

"Spirits help me." 

Aurelius sighed audibly. A thumb and forefinger rubbed at his closed eyelids. 

Watching the two men across him evoked the image of children fighting over the sandbox. He was torn at being more exasperated by Azarian's hardlined deals, or Seth's pugnacity towards sirens. 

And here he thought nymphs were the most tolerant of species. 

"Look, I understand your concerns," Aurelius raised his head up, plastering a ready smile and his best, most accommodating business tone, "But twenty's highway robbery, even if it's my dick brother coming along. But that can be arranged..." 

Aurelius clasped his hands together. Putting his elbows on the table, he leaned forward in his seat. 

"If you let me interview you a bit. Couple of questions, some demonstrative stuff if you have any abilities. Might put the fear of God back in him if you had any powers," he jerked a thumb towards Seth, before grabbing his teacup again, "I'm doing a study on waterbound morphology. And don't worry about him. My brother won't interfere with the job as much, *I hope*," he paused to give Seth a knowing look, "His cooking's decent too. So, what say you?"

Perhaps he could expound on the phylogeny of sirens to their variegated cousins. Rusalki, the Atargati, Undines. If only he could cut one open and conduct experiments... but alas. A live one would do. Of course, Aurelius would never voice out that stray thought out loud. Not in front of Azarian, atleast. 

Seth had his eyebrow raised whilst this exchange went on, his only reaction to Aurelius bluntly dragging him through the mud. But he fell silent, once again feeling like a dumb thirdwheel whenever Aurelius spoke in words he barely understood. 

Instead, he focused on his mail. 

The bunny wiggled through the window-door and hopped down. A soft thump punctuated the air as it landed on the table. It then turned around to show its bag, which Seth opened the clasp of. Inside were neatly folded slips of paper. So small, that Seth's thick fingertips looked clumsy while riffling through the delicate stack. When he found his own, he delicately plucked that one out, pinched between his fingers. Holding the  tiny letter in his big, rough hands, Seth snapped off the ochre wax seal stamping it shut. 

He unfolded the letter.

There was absolutely nothing written on it. Or, *nothing that prying eyes could read*, because Seth appeared to pore over it seriously. His expression changed from begrudging to contemplative, lips pursed into a tight line and eyebrows furrowed.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1200780278243803147"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Saturday, January 27, 2024 20:32:07 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1200780278243803147">20:32:07</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-53">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e

Wasn’t the younger brother, only moments before raving how much the current price was absolute peanuts? What is five more thousand to deal with the constant thorn in his side, currently stating the fact he wasn’t quite keen on the plan in the first place. That added with an added support, someone to perhaps babysit both of them while on the boat. Oh, and don’t forget the cost of the boat to carry these <span style="font-style:italic"> land-dwellers </span> in places that they wouldn’t be able to survive if not for it. Rocky waters and white caps meant nothing to the siren, who could swim through them with ease. 

Seth is lucky this wasn’t Azari’s home field. On land, he wasn’t very strong. Something about being away from water, a common weakness anyone would guess and assume.  There it was. The act of savagery, what everyone knew about his kind. Does he retort back or bite his tongue? A little push in the whole of it all granted him a harder push back – but were there harsher words than what was just said? 

“ I assure you --” His shoulder dug into the ledge, the frame that stuck out to create a platform at the bottom of the old window. If he’s so worried, why is the siren being <strong> pushed </strong> in that direction. Now it was harder to concentrate, “ -- your friend doesn’t look very appetizing to me.” At first he wanted to comment on the tiny rabbit’s size, but that would only fuel the older brother’s fire to continue his childish endeavour.

However, from this first meeting, this current meeting, it made perfect sense. Albeit perhaps only <span style="font-style:italic"> slightly </span> cautious.   Had he used more scientific words in terms of studying, and conducting – then Azari would immediately cut him down. But this was an interview, something that involved clothes and a light demonstration of water in a cup.  He doesn’t need to tell all, really. 

Though starting to do the exact opposite for Seth by scaring the life out of him might help him more, he decided not to give a quick demonstration. Though while he was paying attention to the parchment in hand ( and may I add if he didn’t want prying eyes, why sit so damn close to begin with ), Azarian brought the closest leg up to press his shoe against the older brother’s side. Not too high, enough to impact the more solid part of his body, mid, connection of femur and hip. Without a moment to spare came the power behind it, hopefully enough to push the distracted big <span style="font-style:italic">dolt </span> far away, and even onto the floor.

He snapped his head back to face his brother, a disapproving look on his face. What could his dear little brother learn from savage sirens like Azarian anyway? Why, Seth was (over)confident to provide any contact Aurelius might need as a subject, just he'd done before. He'd introduced him to druids, sages, and all manner of chimeric beings. He knew a mermaid or two, of the friendlier kind than the merrows. There was no need to cavort with the likes of sirens. 

Narrow-minded, that was what he was. Or perhaps unsettled, that Aurelius was getting a little too friendly with Azarian. 

Seth came prepared with an admonishment flying out of his mouth.

"As if this oaf could teach you anything new–"

He never got to finish that rant. With the unexpected kick, Seth slid across the banquette. The burly man almost fell out of his seat. Half of him was parked at the edge, while his arm held onto the table for purchase. 

"Pfft," Aurelius nearly spat out his drink. He brought up a balled fist and coughed, the tea had gone the wrong way down his throat. Scrawny shoulders bunched up as he tittered in withheld laughter. 

The elder brother blinked, stunned at the strength that easily pelted him off his seat. 

But in no time, that ire returned full force. Seth grit his teeth and glared. 

"What was that for?!"

"This fucking proves it. Don't you see," Seth gestured wildly at Azarian, while hefting himself up to sit properly, "They resort to violence first." 

"Mhmm, s-sure!"

Stuttering, Aurelius sucked in his breath as he calmed down from his fit of giggling, over Seth's theatrics. He'd seen his brother get mauled by all sorts of aggressive creatures, then bear it with stoic face, all while saying some stupidly enlightening line like "*Rel, they're just misunderstood.*" Rare was the instance Seth's patience was tested to the the stress point. 

But somehow, a simple kick from a siren sent them over the edge. *Why was that?*, he wondered inwardly.

Meanwhile, Seth's patience wore thin. 

"That's it."

Seeing Aurelius' mild attitude must've aggravated him. Seth stood up abruptly. He looked just about ready to throw Azarian out. Literally. And if Aurelius didn't know his brother well, he'd have thought that was just an intimidation tactic. 

It wasn't. The nymph cracked his knuckles. 

"Hey wait! Ahaha," Aurelius laughed nervously, leaning up from his seat with his open palms proffered in a placating gesture, "What was in that letter by the way? Work?" 

He peered down at the empty paper on the floor. That was one thing Seth refused to teach him. Their language. Or how to even read the damn thing. Nevertheless, he didn't push it, knowing there was probably a good reason why the Nemeton nymphs preferred to keep a secretive mode of communication. 

"Tch," Seth lowered his hands. 

The distraction seemed to work. That look of unbridled rage subdued to one of withheld contempt, at being unable to mete out his frustrations on Azarian. 

With a huff, Seth backed away and stormed off. The thud of his boots were heavy on the wooden floors. He disappeared into one of the rooms again, presumably to gear up for whatever duty that letter set him out to do.

Isn’t that how the saying went? Seth should know very well how bears were in the wilderness, being a land walking hippie such as himself. 

So long as it’s nothing poking and prodding, cutting open and electrocuting then Azarian was fine by it. A decent conversation, questions about his species didn’t hurt anyone. Secrets would always remain as secrets and whatever questions were shot his way would be answered with simple common knowledge.  That being said, at least the older brother spat out some form of truths, until he got a taste of his own medicine. 

Finally push and shove paid off. Enraging the big brother enough to see the onslaught of embarrassment as he was pushed almost to the floor.  Normally things like this could be handled with looking the other way, but not when the guy literally was trying to make the siren’s life all the more difficult. Who was childish at this point, still Seth who stands shocked, unable to decipher just what the siren did. 

How dare he shove, how dare he retort! Sirens aren’t allowed. See, they’re just savage creatures in the deep dark ocean. This solidifies it. 

Azari pushed himself back up, leaning back against the booth, brushing off the invisible dust, pulling the wrinkles from his collared shirt. Leaving himself open as if waiting for Seth’s counter.  The heat resonated off him, and had it been a legit flame, then the siren would be very uncomfortable. 

But alas, deflection. And it worked!

Quick to pull the trigger, only he’s sure he’ll get the twenty-large out of Aurelius. The time it took for Seth to disappear was short, Azari never bothered to look his way – as a means of not retriggering the tantrum. Once the door was closed, where ever it be, that’s when the siren inhaled deeply. 

Fingernails nervously tapped against the table. “ I apologize for my behaviour. Unprofessional as that may seem, however, he deserved every last drop.”  Only goes to say. Sure Aurelius would agree with him there. Besides, Azari could have easily declined the expedition altogether – prior to him signing anything. 

The folder with the information and maps were gathered up, and folded neatly without damaging any sort of clipping.  “ I trust you will lend me this for the night. I need to understand that specific area.” He had other maps as well, more detailed for the seabed, but this would still come useful. 

“ I will be contacting my family, they will have a boat ready for rations tailoring you and your brother’s needs.” It wasn’t an all inclusive vacation type deal, but enough to last at least the week should it take that long.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1202358370120781824"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Thursday, February 1, 2024 05:02:54 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1202358370120781824">05:02:54</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-63">|| <span title="Username: zephtre

You get used to it. Just ignore him.” That was easier said than done, considering Seth’s treatment of him was vastly different from Azarian’s brief interlude. 

"There's no signal here, by the way," he paused to jerk a thumb towards the door Seth entered, "You'll have to use his phone inside. Probably not what you'd think it is..." For one, the wall-mounted telephone hanging in Seth's room looked positively ancient. It was made of wood and brass, had a rotary dial, and a speaking tube. It'd been there since well before Seth moved here. "But it'll work on any voice comm. I know a bit of technomancy, so just tell me what you're trying to call." 

“*Mmmrhh.*”

The noise could’ve been mistaken for a stomach growling. But the bunny, still there, reminded them of his presence with a grumpy thump on the table. Auelius scoffed. He didn’t even know rabbits could sullenly growl like that. 

He reached for the tea caddy again. There was a small drawer, besides the main container lid Seth hinged open earlier. Gingerly pulling it back revealed grains, berries and fruit. Treats. The only currency that the familiars and animal workers accepted in the glen. Holding it by its antique knob, he shook it towards the rabbit. The bunny hopped over. 

In an almost human-like manner, it dipped its paws in and rifled through the assortment. Its head dived into the drawer, nose twitchy with excitement. After picking a few sunflower seeds, their messenger hopped away. Up the ledge, wiggling out the window, and then taking off into the night. Aurelius slotted the drawer back in its place.

“Nippy little buggers if you don't give them anything," he mumbled.

Used to what? This kind of behaviour from the older brother who was finally out of the picture for now. Did that insinuate there would be a longer time shared with the two? Surely this expedition wouldn’t take the full week, even if the money was pretty good at this point. 

“ I’ll bear that in mind.” It would have to be tolerable, since he couldn’t very well ignore someone who is paid to be part of the search. The least he would have to do is warn his siblings of the older brother’s attitude, because some of them are definitely much more inline with the explosive way out. 

What Azari is trying to say – Seth is damned lucky it wasn’t someone else in his family, otherwise it may have actually gotten serious. At least the siren can hold back his urges  due to age, and well, how long he’s been running the business. 

That’s right. There was a piece of memory coming back, wondering just why the GPS wasn’t at all working and well, Aurelius giving coordinates and land mark directions. At first he thought it was quite primitive, but let’s not discriminate – if it was up to Azari, he would live in the water all the time.  But alas, he had tasks to complete and businesses to run. A clench of his jaw might give away the slight frustration that could break through the tough exterior.  He has no means of at all staying the night with the fear of simply not waking up the next day – who’s to say Seth wasn’t some vindictive person.  When he’s about to speak, he paused. Mouth staying open for a second before closing, blue eyes staring down to the well behaved, yet pushy rodent.

Not ever in Azari’s eight-some years of life had there been so much going on, and in a meeting no less. A certain sibling of his would be delighted to know how the visit to Emerald went, since he wants to be that <span style="font-style:italic"> fish out of water. </span> 

Did the rabbit leave once it got it’s payment? Had it thumped it’s way over towards the siren, with the sudden breathing room, he could scoot more so to the center of the booth. The folder was slid along the table with, being mindful of the neglected tea. “ How does this work.. “ It’s a broad statement to say the least. Odd in itself, as Aurelius seemed jam packed full of knowledge – shouldn’t he have some inkling?

“ Depending on the mission, we usually have about a group of three to five.” Or at least two divers, a pair was much better than one, which Azari strongly disagreed on – even though he was breaking his own rules here. “ This case is rather special, though we will be having one of my siblings onboard to manage the boat we will be using.... I wouldn’t be sending them in the water with me...” --

-- There was a long pause, “ However, I do have some equipment to harness a camera to my chest if you absolutely wanted documentation.. I only cannot guarantee you’ll have the shots you want..” 

There was multiple reasons to keep something like this; “ Also, it hooks up to a computer on board.. so we can observe above, and for when clients want to experience... Normally I charge, though since it’s me who is diving – I will waive the fee.” Azarian had way more experience with the harness to which is didn’t deter his work. 

And besides, it’s the least he could do after pushing Seth almost off the bench.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1203864744189108234"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, February 5, 2024 08:48:41 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1203864744189108234">08:48:41</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-69">|| <span title="Username: zephtre

"Expected as much," he said whilst reaching his hand out, now that the rabbit was gone. The signed parchment and cheque flew up rolled into his palm, he closed his fingers over it. In an instant, it combusted into flame, which rapidly ate it into oblivion, til not even cinder nor waft of smoke was left behind. The triquetra tattoo on the back of his palm glowed for a second, sealing their contract in effect. 

"Well, if you're not diving in solo."

He'd preferred it at first, but given the scope of the job, Aurelius was beginning to ease up on restrictions. 

"Just make sure they don't go into merrow territory too. The stone could be there, though I doubt it from how shallow further inland it is... I'll have to try and negotiate with them first." 

Truthfully, it wasn't Aurelius himself who could do the talking, but rather his brother. Though he hoped they wouldn't have to resort to that. Seth didn't have an ounce of merman blood, or even a friendly association for that matter, but the Nemeton nymphs shared a strain of proto-language to their coastal neighbors. He wasn't just enduring Seth as unwanted baggage. Aurelius remembered that inane, foolish question he'd asked his colleague, the one whose fins were shredded, about why she <span style="font-style:italic">...couldn't just talk fish to them?...</span> as though all merpeople shared a lingua franca. It turns out that insular, lagoonal merfolk had an entirely different culture and language system from their oceanic counterparts. 

Aurelius took back his fountain pen and folder with a swish of his hand. The objects floated back to him, slipping into his open messenger bag, which then magically shut by itself with a clasp. 

"If you notice any differences in the seabed, any err *abnormalities*, take a picture. That's what I wanna see."

Standing by the threshold, leaning on the jamb, Seth watched them as he clapped on the thick leather of his vambraces. He'd donned on boots, padded body armor and a heavy, weighted cloak. Faint, glimmers of silverthread was woven into the lining. The types of creatures that roamed these parts were older than bullets and bombs. For that, Sentinel garb was mired in the past. His whip was strapped to a workbelt, appearing deceptively smooth like any other bullwhip, but thicker. They guarded from the same implements their ancestors faced millennia ago. Claws, talons, fangs, tough hide. It never changed. 

"Getting chummy huh," Seth spoke embittered. Jealousy seeped in again.

Aurelius rolled his eyes. "Yeah, we were discussing how to escape while you're away," he replied dryly.

Sirens did possess some form of it, with their enticing song and tempting looks, however, nothing could beat that little display Aurelius made. A glowing palm, the roar of an explosion at the beginning of this meeting – to the parchment that seemed  to have a life of it’s own. Azarian could have sworn he just sold himself to the devil if he wasn’t as educated.  Mesmorized for the half second it took to bring back the agreement, blue eyes slowly rose up to the younger brother’s face. 

“ I said I was going to be diving solo. I appreciate your concern though, and I still will be telling my worker on the boat about the area.” Just so he could steer clear and find a more appropriate spot to lower anchor and ensure protection. Though with those nifty little tricks, did Mr. Lyr really need any? Even though Seth hadn’t a chance to show off his own qualities didn’t mean he had none up his sleeve – though, judging by display, he was the weaker one of the two?  It’s kind of funny how that worked out, since well, Seth was the elder of the two. At least that’s what was gathered. 

“ Alright, I will.” It’s better to just agree, then pull out and show the equipment once they were on the boat. Maybe Aurelius had no idea what Azarian was trying to explain.

Amusing only to imagine the new garments he sported were because he demanded some sort of round two.  It’s Azarian’s queue none the less. Torso turned as body started to slide to the end of the booth.  “ Ah, we were actually just wrapping up details that needed to be discussed. “ You know, some sort of <span style="font-style:italic"> adult- talk </span>  over the finer more important things. 

Unlike the two brothers, the siren didn’t have any sort of <span style="font-style:italic"> paw – delivery </span> services, and clearly couldn’t scream this far towards the ocean for anyone else to hear. He’ll have to make his was back to the pier. Or at least when his phone started to get service back.  “ I believe this concludes our meeting, Mr. Lyr. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to contact my siblings.” 

Azarian stood up, running his hands down pants to smooth out the invisible wrinkles. <span style="font-style:italic"> Ugh, </span> this type of threads were ridiculously constricting. Something the siren would probably never ever get used to wearing – even though it was a must among these land-dwellers.  The coat was in the midst of being lightly buttoned up.

Aurelius acknowledged with another subtle nod. He had no other additional comments on Azarian’s determination to dive alone. This went along with his suggestion earlier. And anyhow, eased his mind on attracting merrow aggression, if only one foreigner was diving so close to their boundary line. 

“Peachy keen,” he said with two clicks of his tongue. His now-gloved hand touched two fingers to his eyebrow, flicking them into a casual sallute, “We’ll be there sharpish, o’ Cap’n.”</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1210565173685780521"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Friday, February 23, 2024 20:33:48 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1210565173685780521">20:33:48</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-77">Seth’s lips creased into a smile. 

“You sure? It’s a long way back to the shore from here.”

Was that concern about Azarian’s wellbeing?

“Gets dangerous out there. You could stay the night,” he paused, leaning back into the other room to sling a heavy leather satchel over his shoulder, “But if you insist, just stay on the main road and you’ll be fine.”

Miraculously, there was no catch. No dry smartassery attached, no petulant infantile quips. It sounded like genuinely sensible—though obvious—advice to bid farewell on.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1210565174939881472"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Friday, February 23, 2024 20:33:48 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1210565174939881472">20:33:48</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-78">“…Ooookay, well,” Aurelius sucked in a breath through his teeth.

Perhaps it was best to not let the Azari tarry. Green eyes darted back to the siren. “See you soon.

Staying the night was only a death wish, and Azarian knew surely he probably wouldn’t wake up the next day.  Besides, there’s only so long he could really stand walking and using <span style="font-style:italic"> legs. </span> 

“ Thank you for the advice..” Azari couldn’t remember the guy’s name, and well, didn’t want to call him <span style="font-style:italic"> big brother </span> anyways. 


Finally free, the door is closed to the rental, engine turning on with a press of a button. These automobiles were getting rather technologic these days – even if all the navigation instruments were absolute trash in this part of the woods. But once he found his way there, surely it’ll be easy going back? The one good thing was the signs, and where there was only one sign that Azari came across coming here – he knows there will be one coming back. Legit a turn off the main road, though far, it would be difficult to get lost. 

That’s the dangerous part right? Not to mention, the thick vegetation of the area made it suffocating, amplifying that already dark and dense nature of the archipelago. Even the goddamn radio didn’t work, so it was just Azari left alone with his thoughts as he steered through the small road wondering just <strong> how </strong> the thick forest grew so much with the lack of sunlight for food. 

This among multiple other stupid questions popped up, followed with snorting and a bit of mumbling under his breath. Nothing more, nothing less.  
<img style="display:inline-flex;vertical-align:middle;width:25px;height:25px" title=":blank:" id=":blank:" src="../emojis/blank_1119673702993379348.png" alt=":blank:"></p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1212126870586261515"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Wednesday, February 28, 2024 03:59:26 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1212126870586261515">03:59:26</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-81">An hour of driving had came and went before issues started to present themselves. What was felt as a <span style="font-style:italic"> clunk </span> ended up being nothing much but a few bumps in the road prior – though as he turned the winding road, his tire started to flatten.  Thank god those digital readings weren’t malfunctioned due to the boonies Mr.Lyr lived in... So it was obvious as whistles would sound off, indicators lighting up the dashboard followed by a pull to the left and that unmistakable sound of rubbing dragging the dirt road. 

“ Oh for --” First and immediate thought was the big brother himself. Still obviously salty from the meeting earlier, and being almost pushed off the banquet – but he deserved it all! Azarian was laughing at that point, finding the reasoning behind it absolutely hilarious. He wouldn’t sabotage his vehicle, right? 

Seatbelt was unclasped, needing no flashlight thanks to his species trait of seeing in the dark. The siren exited the Jeep, going directly to the problem as where the vehicle told him. 

A stick, a rather large stick. Something carved and ornate, as if it was part of a fence, or canopy to a home. Regardless it was large, and stabbed through the sidewall which immediately Azarian understood as to why it didn’t blow right there and then. Taking the corner may have dislodged it, letting the air finally seep out. He was stuck! 

Other than the constant beeping of his rental, the outside life had a moderate buzz to it. You could hear the ocean waves off in the distance, among the insects and animal life. Nothing too serious, that was until he Azari heard the cracks of branches breaking closer in the small ditch. It happened just when the large item was pulled from his tire, and he used it as a weapon, holding it up while staring off into the darkness trying to pinpoint what made that sound.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1212126947853869086"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Wednesday, February 28, 2024 03:59:44 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1212126947853869086">03:59:44</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-82"><img style="display:inline-flex;vertical-align:middle;width:25px;height:25px" title=":blank:" id=":blank:" src="../emojis/blank<span style=" font-style:italic"="">1119673702993379348.png" alt=":blank:"/&gt; 
 Crack, crack, crack! <span style="font-style:italic"> 

There it was again, was it getting closer? What type of dangers was on this isle anyways? Surely his humanoid stature could be intimidating to a coyote, or something of that size. 

What if it wasn’t that? 

</span> Crack, crack, crack! <span style="font-style:italic"> 

Now the rustling of leaves picked up as wind penetrated the dense forest. It distorted his hearing, and well, kind of scared him – and for once it’s seen across the siren’s face. He made no pause, immediately quickening his pace to throw himself back in the rental. Doors immediately locked, head lights remaining on. Lastly, hazards were set on, feeling the blinking might attract some other local for assistance. 

When was morning? Oh wait, the sun never really made any appearance ... so .. 

... when is it </span> safe _ to travel? 

First couple hours that past by were anxiety stricken. Azarian kept finding himself looking around the vehicle to make sure doors were locked, and nothing was lurking. He also scanned the outer surroundings behind the glass windows, finding absolutely nothing.  Then time was spent on the dashboard, trying to see if the GPS would work, or the SOS button. Phone was turned on and off, battery taken out and put back in. Even moving the thing around the interior as if trying to find that sweet spot for a crumb of a signal. 

The third hour realization started to sink. He would have to go outside no matter what. No one is there to help him, and he needs to make it back to the pier.  But right now? He needs a moment to collect himself. To muster up the courage – sure this would never happen in the water, but on land Azari knew he wasn’t as strong.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1212126984251904032"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Wednesday, February 28, 2024 03:59:53 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1212126984251904032">03:59:53</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-83">|| <span title="Username: zephtre

A small, furry face poked out from the eaves of branch and leaf, hiding its white body in obscurity. It'd hopped off the roof before Azari could see it, and quickly scurried to hide up a tree. His familiar was sent to watch the siren. What it witnessed, Seth saw miles away.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1212742777025335337"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Thursday, February 29, 2024 20:46:49 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1212742777025335337">20:46:49</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-85">He chuckled darkly at the round, coppery mirror in his palm. Hazy glass reflected the panicked expression on the siren's face. With a turn of his hand, the image on the mirror panned to the rest of the car. Maki, miles away, moved her head to mirror--pun intended--that in synchronicity. As Seth expected, Azarian was stuck. The worn dirt path, normally dry, would eventually change too. The monster they were hunting was a creature of borders: crosses, roads, paths, bridges... it affected those areas in particular. But so far, he'd seen nothing to indicate that the beast was near Azarian. 

He could help the siren though, in the meantime. 

"Oi, Seth!" a voice beckoned for his attention. 

<span style="font-style:italic">Or, he could leave the siren to rot in fear.</span> Seth snapped the lid shut over the mirror, which shrunk it to a small medallion. This severed his connection with Maki. Her master had bid her to return. With a little squeak, she shook her head and proceeded to leave the area with haste. Even the small woodland creatures felt an off air with the place. Seth, in his complacency, didn't bother to check further.

Too quiet. For a place this densely packed with vegetation, nary a sound of an animal or noisome insects could be heard after Maki left. It was, as Azarian heard, only whispery breezes and plant matter reacting to their caress.

So when something, or *someone*, came out from the shadows, there was no forewarning. The figure of a woman stumbled out. Immediately swathed in the bright overcast of Azarian's headlights, every detail was highlighted. There was an ugly, large gash across her temple. Black, scraggly hair and her loose, torn shift clung to her clammy, sallowed skin. She was caked in dried dirt and blood. Her belly was swollen, suggesting was with child. And yet the rest of her pointed to a different affliction. Sunken cheeks, a gaunt, listless expression. Flesh draped on her like sheets over furniture. With her décolletage hung so low on sagging breasts, the prominence of collarbones and ribs impressed through. 

She staggered a bare foot out of the bush. The woman raised an arm, showing a frail, knobby  wrist too thin for someone of her stature. Dry lips moved to silently implore, but no sound spilt out. Her appearing presented Azarian with decisions to make. And whichever path the siren took, would influence how the rest of the night went on.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1212743061273190401"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Thursday, February 29, 2024 20:47:57 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1212743061273190401">20:47:57</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-87">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e

-- The question had to come up sometime. Were all nymphs such petty little things? If it was ever found out, then these questions would be asked to some trust-worthy company and explained with some examples to beef up his case. 

That darling little rodent wasn’t even seen throughout. The noises the wilderness gave off were set aside for a more sinister route the siren’s mind took. Surely this place was haunted, or rather stalked by a vicious beast who wasn’t so much intimidated by humanoid figures like himself. 

Did that mean whatever watched the siren was humanoid itself?  His fingers tapped against the steering wheel of the vehicle, icy eyes staring off where the headlamps illuminated.  Stuck in a daze, a race of the mind, constantly overthinking while trying to figure out a way out of this mess. Perhaps he should have just stayed the night at Mr. Lyr’s house – because being on guard in bed might have been better than taking this chance? 

“ What am I thinking.. “ A laugh, a hand that ran through white locks that escaped a loose ribbon.  Taking this chance would be the better option, since well, Azari had a chance of making it back in one piece.  Even though he stared out in front of him, it took few seconds to acknowledge the movement that started.

And <span style="font-style:italic"> oh boy.... </span>

Pupils shifted, grip around the steering wheel tightened as arms straightened to push him back against his seat. What, who, why!?  The paranormal was never given a second thought in the siren’s mind, though the figure in front of him was unmistakably <span style="font-style:italic"> supernatural. </span> And not in the sense that explained the whole of the archipelago. 

“ Nope... no, nope... nope, nu uh.”  He leaned forward, pulling one hand away to the ignition where button was pressed at the same time while he braked.  The car roared with bells and whistles sounding off about one of the tires being flat. At this point though, does he care? Not at all, not even for the damage he might cause while driving on it.  This is what insurance is for and he’ll explain himself to his higher ups should he be questioned. For now the machine was placed in reverse, once the camera appeared on the screen he started accelerate. 

Did he get far? Perhaps not. It’s hard to manoeuvre around a twisted and narrow passageway. Not to mention the sudden softening of the dirt road only added more of a headache. Even harder to get traction than with snow – a potential to be shovelled out. Whereas mud, well, the stuff only filled the hole that was already made.  He’s stuck, and he’s now freaking out. 

Does Azarian get out? Was that a wise thing to do? Panic behind widened eyes as seatbelt was undone before his hand slammed against the horn. Scare it away? Make sure it doesn’t come any closer? Anything threatening.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1214345707641901106"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Tuesday, March 5, 2024 06:56:18 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1214345707641901106">06:56:18</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-90">|| <span title="Username: zephtre

It disoriented her, for but a second. But when she realized this was all bark and no bite, the ghastly woman lowered her arms and stumbled on. She trampled onto the dirt road. Dirt that wasn’t as dry as it used to be. Footprints impressed on spongy soil, moisture pooled out.

An inconspicuous detail. But that was exactly what was happening to his car too. Soon, Azari would feel the vehicle slow down the further he reversed, until in just a few cycles, it refused to budge any further. There was a sudden jerk, as if the car was caught on a snag. 

Something wanted him to stay. 

The soil took on a different texture. Silty and dense. If Azari looked down, he'd see it bubbling and frothing with objects that emerged from its geological depths. There was industrial refuse - in bits of paper, plastic, and twisted metal. And then there was organic waste. Bone, gristle, stumps of unrecognizable limbs, coming from equally unrecognizable sources. Both roiled into the slowly churning mud, desquamating grotesquely. 

Whatever horrid smell developed, it was seeping inside. It accumulated in far faster than the vents should've allowed, defiling Azarian's olfactory senses. 

The tires were slowly sinking, and now it seemed as if the siren was being gassed out. 

With a burst of speed, the woman jack-knifed forward. Mud clung bony ankles, but she managed to take her steps out at every move, allowing her to reach the car. She flung her arms onto he hood, one outstretched towards the window. Fingers scraped on the glass, pawing at Azarian sitting inside. Her lips moved, but again no words came out. Unblinking eyes were transfixed on the man inside.

It was weak, as befitted her appearance. But what it gave her strength was disregard for pain or self-preservation. She continued to pound nonstop, until her fists would surely bruise. It did more than bruise, in fact. Her sallow, paper skin was beginning to slough off her in wilted flakes. 

She opened her mouth again, revealing yellowed teeth. Like the ground beneath, her cheeks grew flabby and drooped, as if melting off her bones.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1215627673011880006"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Friday, March 8, 2024 19:50:22 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1215627673011880006">19:50:22</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-93">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e

There was some shred of hope, and for a split second, Azarian’s mouth gave a slight curve of amusement. That’s right, leave the vicinity, and leave the siren alone.  He can finally rest now and figure out the situation with the vehicle surely. 

Surely.. 

The second of reassurance was fleeting with the pungent odour overpowering it. As stated, it did assault Azarian’s senses – which were definitely heightened by his species. Not only that, but those beady voided ocular stared with malice that forced an audible gulp from the siren’s throat. Tightening his steering wheel as body lurched in fear to the banging against the hood of the vehicle. She – no, <strong> this monster </strong> was getting closer. It wanted something. It wanted the siren. 

Fight or flight, decision was always up in the air. Things were much easier to prey on in the water, hell, the marrows didn’t scare him at all. But this thing? And while stuck in a field that didn’t pleasantly compliment his style. Thinking of what to do now just wasn’t in the cards. It’s time to leave, and if the vehicle was such a piece  that it couldn’t provide a simple task – well..

As hand wrapped around the handle, it took no extra time to pull, foot following suit to kick the door open. It rocked back on hinges, stopped as he turned to try to exit. 

Alas, he’s stopped dead in his tracks and he’s screaming again, perhaps a bit louder since now he wasn’t confined to a box. The fucking seatbelt. The one thing that might stop him worse, and almost become the fatal mistake. Azari was leaning out as hands immediately went to the clasp, taking longer than anticipated due to the sheer panic. This time he did look away,  desperately trying and <strong> finally </strong> freeing himself. Leaning already, the siren took a dive in the soft earth – something that clearly resembled that from <span style="font-style:italic"> Poltergeist. </span>  Mud was diluted, and surfaced things you would find in a horror flick – not on a dirt fucking road in Emerald?! 

Azarian was crawling at first, falling as he tried to pull himself up to stand.

And so she supped on the frenzied emotions welling up in Azari. His pain energized her efforts. 

That was, until he kicked the door out. 

Standing so close to it, the frailty of her weight (or rather the lack of it) easily gave way. She fell back to the rotten, revoltingly undulating mud. That bought Azari precious few seconds of time to get away. 

Time which he fumbled, nevertheless. In the haste of getting the seatbelt off, she’d heaved herself up. Emaciated arm on the hood, shambling feet dragged around to reach him. 

As Azarian hit the fetid beginnings of a bog, the mud *reacted*. Not in the way moisture naturally would—that vile mixture of liquified grime, coagulated gore, and rancid water. It declined to obey to what the siren knew was true to the ocean. There was a lack of spatter, of rippling out at the falling body. Instead, the initial splash held cohesively. Like the claws of an awaiting predator, the silty effluvia clung to Azari’s legs. 

To make matters worse, the detritus in the mud took on some character as well. Bits of litter caressed Azarian’s calves. A scrape of broken chicken bone, malformed plastic, the abhorrent pulsing of some kind of offal, amongst others. These were stranded into thinner strips. They flexed and curled, caressing along blue-tinged skin. Soothing. A mother’s gentle stroke upon a fussy babe. <span style="font-style:italic">Like fingers.</span> Yes, that was it. Hands that sought to keep Azarian tethered, to return to the earthly womb.  

But it was futile. Its shoddily cobbled-together hands were too decayed to find purchase on supple skin. The siren slipped through without resistance. 

We return to the woman in pursuit. She’d staggered close, but stopped. When Azari was still in the throes of passing the threshold between bog and solid ground, she could’ve leapt to drag him back in.

There she stood motionless. Then she opened her mouth. The advanced deterioration shown on her face. So much so, that she was slack-jawed. Literally. Her jaw unhinged open and loose, swinging by the droopy flesh still clinging onto sunken cheeks. 

<span style="font-style:italic">Szhhrrrrrrr.</span> 

That was the sound of the radio cranked high up. Static crackle. She hadn’t touched it at all.

<span style="font-style:italic">Tuuuuuuuuuh— T-Tuuuuuuh—</span>

Without warning, the car alarm sputtered to life. It whanged on and on in its repetitive tune. Then in a few seconds, it’s rhythm was interrupted. 

It kept repeating, adding another string of sound from the alarm. 

<span style="font-style:italic">Aaaaa ouhhhhhh— Aaaaa ouhhhhhh—</span> 

The rental shuddered and heaved, huffing and puffing from as strain bore down on it. 

<span style="font-style:italic">Pp, ppp, ppppuh.</span>

The cacophony of sound combined into one whole. In order. For she could not speak as humans do, she allowed machines and dead things to do the speaking for her. The more the sounds melded together, some hoarse, phantom-like overtone glided over it, a whisper in the wind. 

<span style="font-style:italic">Stop.</span>

Perhaps she wanted him to stop, or maybe this denoted that <span style="font-style:italic">she</span> stopped. 

One answer was correct here. That  was likely the latter. With Azarian on dry land, she could not latch to him anymore, he was out of the bog’s boundary.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1218981828887707749"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, March 18, 2024 01:58:35 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1218981828887707749">01:58:35</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-99">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e

 Besides, the distraction was in the swamp-mud. A tickle, a scratch, something that could lead to sepsis or cardiac arrest as more and more unwanted junk surfaced, surrounded. The thought to possess the liquidy substance didn’t even cross his mind, and if it did he wasn’t sure if he could mend. Every time feet would thrash, rather than sinking back in the resistance disappeared. He wasn’t sinking, no, but gliding forward effortlessly until the very end was well within reach.  

Had Azarian paid attention to the magically forming sludge, this may have not gone as smoothly as it did. Still, laboured breath as he pushed through this anxiety stricken nightmare, fingers clawed at the <strong> actual </strong> ground, pulling closer, then pushing to a rigid stand. So quick a movement that he might feel it in his lower back later – if he could escape this.

Turning, the dirtied siren stared wide eyed to <span style="font-style:italic"> the thing. </span>  The flashing of the headlamps as horn blared in staccato, illuminating a yellowish tint against her rotting face. Honestly, it made it scarier, knowing the holes along her face were clearly holes while shadow flickered along the brush bordering shoulder of the road. 

Finally, the sound. Like a high pitch ringing, or grinding styro-foam together. An unhealthy sound that would force teeth to fall out right there, lips curving inwards as eyes closed. A shiver to conclude, unwarranted and most certainly not ending in a pleasurable experience. 

<span style="font-style:italic"> Stop. </span> Clear, plain as day. A voice unrecognizable from the radio stations he would listen to seldom. Seldom, but still could be depicted – and obvious as the tone, though clear, carried an unnatural tone to it. 

Knees that hands rested against, breathing deep – he took one more last look up, then down. Could someone figure out something so soon? The swamp goop was limited, or rather, it didn’t bother to take the rest of the road, right under the siren’s feet. 

Does that mean he should stay and test it? 

<strong> Absolutely not </strong> 

What kind of idiot in their right mind would <span style="font-style:italic"> stay?  </span> 

Respectful to those ... <span style="font-style:italic"> land folk </span> still, and rather not suffer from any malicious backlash – Azari, once breath caught up, turned and started to book it down the road.

As Azarian fled the scene, the woman was left rooted to the spot. The soupy mud beneath her feet bubbled, the tendrils of refuse and ordure lapped at her calves. She sank without resistance. It reclaimed her back into its fetid womb. Long after the siren left her vicinity, the woman was buried alive. Or dead, depending on the perspective. How much <span style="font-style:italic">alive</span> was she in the first place?

That was a question left unanswered. Azarian had other things to worry about. 

The farther away from her, the farther he was from the only source of light coming from the car. Moonlight shied from Azari. Or perhaps it was the forest conspiring against him. The leafy canopy was thickest in the middle of the woods, the blanket of foliage kept the area suffocatingly dark. Still ominously silent, Azari's only companions were the thrum of their heartbeat and the distant wail of the car, fast fading. Towering redwood trunks creaked as though to peer down at this speck on the ground. Undergrowth was sparse, leaving the siren exposed to their very steps.

Nothing but pitch black and heaving exhortations. This went on for a long while. Several minutes. 

Perhaps it was just so dark to see the shadowy figure bolted right in Azarian's path. 

"Uff," a voice grunted.

With the speed the siren took, it was no gentle collision. Azarian would bump into a solid, sturdy figure. ~~Right in the titties.~~ The shadow stumbled, but held on to Azari's arm. It wasn't until the gloved hand led up to narrowed, green eyes and a familiar mop of flaxen hair, that Seth's likeness stared down at the siren. 

"Oh, it's you," he echoed.

They appeared to be a ragtag group of men, shifters, and other xenians. 

"Get back," one of them ordered, a centaur-woman of considerable height and musculature. 

Obediently, the rest of them parted away, revealing what it was they were peering at: an abnormal outgrowth on the ground. Where its once boggy sink was, it'd ballooned up to swallow its hapless victim. Yes, there was someone inside this thing. This was what Azarian just narrowly avoided. The mud had hardened and dried up to cracked silicate, parched of moisture. But in between those cracks, one could glimpse through the feculent, translucent membrane. Like a pus-filled cyst, the mound distended. 

Despite its dried out exterior, it moved. Pulsed. Undulated as a beating heart would. 

With a grunt and a swing of her axe, the centaur lodged into the thick shell, creating a larger crack. Rearing up on her hind legs, the hooves on her front ones kicked the slates of dried mud away. Without prompting, the others assisted in prying and peeling off the flakes. Now they could fully see that dun-hued membrane, as well as the immobilized figure inside it. 

One of them looked to their leader, who trod back and nodded to the junior in their group. Brandishing a knife, the boy plunged it into the membrane. He cut across as much as he could, ripping it open. Viscous, pungent liquid gushed out from the wound. The sludge of digested refuse turned to thick mush inside. There was a hiss of air wheezing out, sounding disturbingly human, palpable as a sigh of relief.

"Where'd he go?" a pair of sentinels lagging behind the group whispered, they glanced around, but couldn't find a trace of Seth anywhere.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1220614508255645757"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Friday, March 22, 2024 14:06:16 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1220614508255645757">14:06:16</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-106">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e

Imagine if the siren was some hot head cocky nymph with a dollop of pettiness. The old rotting bag of bones would surely swallow him whole in an instant, merging one with the putrid chicken bones and other human trash disrespectfully tossed. 

Had she swallowed the vehicle instead with her? Information about the siren had been left inside, not to mention the notes Aurelius so diligently put together. A mistake, but surely he had a damn good reason as to why they weren’t grabbed.  If insurance wouldn’t understand, then cash would be forked out instead. A small little blip in the business, but not grand enough to cause a dent in income.  If she left the machinery by it’s lonesome, then small repairs and a good cleaning company  would fix it all. 

But alas, Azarian’s mind was far from any of that. He still currently keep a staggered pace, breathing as if he were out of breath. 

Swimming was so much easier, the use of large fins and a strong tail to propel him forward effortlessly. On land there was gravity to be dealt with, weighing him down even more as he still tried to grow accustomed to the legs he sported. Damn feet could easily trip on the multiple pieces of debris of wandering oaks. A path not really a path, but chosen none the less – anything that would get him as far away from <strong> that thing </strong> as possible. 
<img style="display:inline-flex;vertical-align:middle;width:25px;height:25px" title=":blank:" id=":blank:" src="../emojis/blank_1119673702993379348.png" alt=":blank:"></p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1221589394981523557"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, March 25, 2024 06:40:07 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1221589394981523557">06:40:07</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-108">The darkness of the ocean was a different kind from that on land. Mesh of trees distorting the moonlight, making it all the more suffocating. Air was dense to begin with, sickly sweet with the taste of what he just trudged through.  

Looking down the entire time, Azari is bound to knock into something. Whether it be a tree, a bush, some broad chest from the guy he kicked off the banquet seat.  Is it better to take his chances with the bog bitch maybe? Initial collision felt much different than a tree. Solid, but soft in comparison, face void of any scratches by twigs or thorns. A mouthful of something like this would definitely be inviting in a place like Pleonexia, though perhaps not when he was trying to run away. 

No humanoids were within the vicinity, or at least Azari thought he was alone – and only until he felt a hand wrap around his arm to keep him steady. To keep him, there?  The siren’s own reaction, mixed with the escape of laboured breath was to push. To use that initial impact to his advantage, flattening his palm against whatever chest that collided with him. Arm tried to yank itself free from the grip as body stepped back to create a comfortable distance  from the one who stopped him in his tracks. 

This time Azarian is looking up, and it’s easily to notice the familiarity of the figure that appeared randomly in front of him. 

<span style="font-style:italic"> Oh, it’s you </span> 

Forget the past, now is not a time to bring up stupid grudges or point fingers. Those bright blue eyes that seemed so calm and collective as with the rest of his expression was only stricken with terror still. Not to mention that pungent smell of hot garbage clung onto him as with the mud along his face, in his hair, on his clothes.

“ We need to go, hurry!”  There’s no time to waste. He wouldn’t take his chances by bringing the dumb brother to the being. What if <span style="font-style:italic"> he </span> wasn’t strong enough?  Besides, the forest ranger would know where to find civilization again, or at least have some other mode of transport.  This time his hand reached out, mimicking the motion of the guy in front, latching around wrist. 

“ Let’s go, we need help, there’s a monster back there!”  The siren tugged, trying to initiate back into a jog.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1221589495317528687"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, March 25, 2024 06:40:31 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1221589495317528687">06:40:31</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-110">|| <span title="Username: zephtre

Slow down - " the blond acted up immediately. What snarky remark Seth was about to say died down. It took time to register the genuine panic filling Azarian. They've only met, but the other man's trussed up appearance was cause for concern. Like he'd totaled into a ditch and just barely scraped out alive and well. Maybe now wasn't the time for smarting quips. 

Seth stumbled after the siren, righting his steps quickly to catch up. 

"What monster?" he called out, trying to get a grip on the situation. Literally, as he flicked his wrist slightly to grasp back at Azari. Fingers closed into the meat of Azarian's palm. That was <span style="font-style:italic">almost</span> a handhold there. But he was taken in by their harried state. He tugged back, but in a different direction Azari initially took. He knew these woods better than the siren. "Tell me exactly what it looked like," Seth punctuated sternly, trying to clear through the daze of Azarian's fear. 

As he led the siren more confidently, his pace overtook them. Now it was Seth bearing forward, holding onto Azarian by the hand as he weaved through near-identical trees, rocks and landmarks that would've confused anyone unfamiliar with the territory.

Once the cleave was made, the mucus sac regurgitated its musty contents. It was its last, jerky movement. The pulsing rhythm stopped from hereon. From where the membrane was split, the lumps of half-digested matter came out in a congealed gloop. 

Fresh recruits in the Guard shied away, feet pulling back and faces turned away in revulsion. But the veterans only drew closer.

"Get her out of there," their centaur leader urged. 

Without hesitating, several arms sunk into the mire. Despite the viscous consistency, they could see through better without the shell or membrane obscuring their view. Hands found purchase around the limp figure lying in wait. Foraging through the oleaginous muck, the sentinels pulled off the arms wrapped around the young girl. 

Arms that were reduced to a feeble thinness. Lying behind the young girl was a sunken, shriveled face, dried out, despite the fluid they were immersed in. It cradled its charge like a newborn. The ghastly appearance mirrored the wretch Azarian faced earlier. But this one was completely dead. Unmoving. Its body was a slowly disintegrating husk. The temporary vitality that kept her moving was drained out. 

It was what kept the young girl inside alive. 

Azarian passed through the threshold of life and death. But, without knowing he'd gone in the wrong direction. These "bog witches" were protectors. The encased the weary, the vulnerable and the lost. 

<span style="font-style:italic">From what?</span> was a question left unanswered.

"Dea guide you," came the doddering murmurs of an old woman, who genuflected at the head of the earthen cyst, and drew invisible signs over the broken flesh-seam. Conferring a blessing of some sort. 

"One, two!" another voice led.

On the third unspoken beat, everyone lifted the girl out of the liquid. The dead witch's arms held no resistance, they parted.

So the big brother did have a brain after all. It wasn’t full of witty comments and petty gestures. He could be that saving knight if he wanted to – was Azari really thinking him his rescuer?  Never afraid to ask for assistance, stubbornness only kept you wedged in tough spaces. Again, had this been the old, dense life of the ocean he would be good. A giant rabid murderous squid, or those tell tale ferocious merrows? No sweat off his back – if sirens could even <span style="font-style:italic">perspirate. </span>

Slow down? How could someone slow down after witnessing something that should only be found in campy horror films. Strength that only could be brought up in these tribulating times, pushing a large and rather bulky ranger like <span style="font-style:italic"> big brother </span> here. Tugging him with ease, through the darkened woods blindly. “ Back there!” Azari has no time to point, he’s too busy still trying to make great distance between, fear of the ground softening and trying to swallow him whole once again if they stopped for a breather.  To be fair, the speed wasn’t even that fast, not comparing to the laboured breathing the siren sported. 

He stunk, of the very thing he was running away from. The dirt on body would have made a perfect imprint on Seth’s chest during the initial run in. Mud among other rotten debris stuck in the poor siren’s normally stark white hair. A chicken bone here, perhaps a wrapper there, but looks weren’t at all his top priority. In fact, the smell was so putrid, his fear enabled him a strong stomach – though was Seth the same? Soil stained the ranger’s wrist, then covered his hand as he tried to reposition himself. To gain control of the situation, and take lead.

In fact, the thought of him and Aurelius literally speaking to a rabbit slipped his mind. That would indicate this big gumpy tall ass lurch looking mother fucker should know his way about better than a disorientated ocean dweller. 

What did it look like? A monster for <span style="font-style:italic">fuck sake! </span>  Some sort of ghastly face, hollow eyes and perhaps sharp enough teeth to rip the flesh off clean to the bone. Maybe even taking the bone with. Azari was at a loss of words, only from imagining the look this wiry woman gave him as she made his car almost sink with the manipulation of the ground itself. 

Sternly punctuated or not, the siren wasn’t going to bother answering that. It wasn’t as relevant like trying to get further and further away. 

Now he’s being tugged in a different direction, his feet stumbling in the beginning, trying to find perfect pace to keep up with long strides. Yet that was soon to change when feet just kicked up a mere second, his other hand coming around to clasp the one that held his other. From there his heels dug into the ground, to deter the current path at hand. “ Stop! Where are you going?” This wasn’t the right way at all. 

“ I knew it, you’re trying to lead us back to it!” Were those tears? Could siren’s even shed things such as tears? Regardless there’s betrayal, and a pit growing in his stomach.

A certain resistance was keeping him from pushing on. And that resistance was the ever-increasing fear in Azari. 

"What? No," he protested, trying to pull back, "That doesn't make sense-"

The blond was trying to reason here, with someone who's critical faculties were compromised. A futile effort, of course. Azari was distraught–likely by the foreboding and maddening difficulty of orienting oneself, using landmarks that looked the same whichever way one went–but Seth was too stuck up in his pride to notice. When it came to corralling newcomers, he expected obedience. They followed, he led. No questions asked. No qualms given. He espected it like it was a given.

What an insufferable dolt Seth was.

In his eyes, Azarian was nothing more than unruly livestock. So he treated the other man like one. If a ditzy little lost lamb was wandering near danger, a guardian dog wasn't above forcibly displacing them from said danger. 

"No," he repeated stubbornly, yanking his hand off. With a big stride, he overtook Azarian. Before the siren could react to him blocking the way, Seth  dived down. One hand grabbed onto a wrist, slinging it over him as he ducked his head down. The other arm was clamped tight around Azarian's knees, buckling them together. 

When he stood up, the siren bobbed in half. Their hips were perched on a broad shoulder. Seth didn't care about soiling his clothes with the goop the siren was coated in. Azarian was hefted up with ease. He held on firmly, expecting squirms and struggles. 

Carrying the siren like a potato sack, Seth continued back to his original path. He didn't huff or pant with effort despite Azarian's added weight. And still, the scenery passed by in a blur as he made quick work through the undergrowth.

Stubby legs pranced along a white, furred body. Maki. She was squeaking loudly in alarm. Small head lifted, her eyes reflected a tinge of green. Audible enough to try catching their attention. But Seth gave no regard, nor did it seem like Azarian could free themselves just yet. 

Maki hopped up, digging her claws on one pant legs. She scratched and bit where she could, but it was hopeless. In a motion uncharacteristic of the nymph, Seth grabbed the ferret by the scruff, and hurled her aside. Discarded like trash. There was a pitiful peal of surprise as Maki thumped against a trunk. She dropped to the ground, squeaking in pain.

Commendations should be given to Azarian's gut instinct. 

Because as it turns out, his dread was spot on.

Azarian was in capable hands. But not the ones that were supposed to catch him.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1226462942418042890"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, April 7, 2024 17:25:52 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1226462942418042890">17:25:52</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-120">"Fuck," he cursed under his breath when a searing pain throbbed along his back, mimicking what his poor familiar received. Maki was down for the count. Eyes closed for a moment, teeth gritting as he shook his head to sever their empathic link. Should they continue, his subconscious desires to follow would override his familiar's instinct for self-preservation. This wasn't Maki's first impact. That <span style="font-style:italic">thing</span> had been rebuffing her stalking by kicking and throwing her away. 

But he kept on moving. Or rather, the huge Ossory wolf he rode tore through the moor at breakneck speed. Cold winds whipped against his face. 

The real Seth was still some distance away. After all, he'd been far away when it happened, still convening with the rest fo the Sentinels in that village. He couldn't have teleported so fast at Azarian's time of need. 

When he'd broken away to interview the houses earlier, a picture formed that they were on the wrong track. The creature they hunted was going eastwards, not west. 

From then on, he bolted away. Seth needn't stick around with the others, who were still questioning the rescued girl from that bog witch's womb. He'd gotten his own confirmation through Maki, the poor thing now resting by the tree roots. When–as she headed back to him–he perceived through her eyes an eerie lookalike. There was no single instance in these woods for a doppelgänger to appear with good intentions.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1226463131895730248"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, April 7, 2024 17:26:37 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1226463131895730248">17:26:37</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-121">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e

A vehicle sinking into the earth. The ground becoming soft as rot overtook it like the plague. 

Not even the petty blond big brother himself, roaming in the thick forest without a light. 

Because, he would need some sort of light, because <strong> no one </strong> could navigate blindly through here, no matter how long you’ve been alive – right? 

A mind that ran a million miles a second, a scarred, a frightened siren that made everything ridiculous a common reality. Had intuition been looked at more carefully then perhaps a better fight might have been put up. Though, if Seth really decided to move off into the direction Azarian thought was back to the bog wench – he still would have grave issue to follow. 

“ It is!” <span style="font-style:italic"> It does. </span>  All the sense in the world was taken in by those two words, which could burst any moment at the seam. 


Did those scratches bleed? Delicate skin lightly torn, causing some sort of abrasion that rose by small traces of the siren’s poisonous glands, thanking his genus. Not nearly enough to cause any sort of disdain to any sort of specimen that it infected. Like a cat scratch, where a bite might be deadlier.

They hadn’t crossed that line where the siren undoubtedly needed to defend himself Even as the next steps what the blond was about to do, coming to light. Hand escaped a thought to be impossible grip, then as stride gobbled up the short distance between one came to shield his face. Eyes closed in a flinch, other hand darting out as if scared of the sudden intimidation. A very unlike gesture of the siren, but he was being irrational in everything.  

“ Don’t!” With body language that was stern, promising something unfavourable should the simple blond actually execute to hitting him. 

But that wasn’t the case, through the cracks of fingers which moved as body was touched, easily scooped like – yes, a sack of potatoes. Struggle, it’s everyone’s go to in a predicament like this. What in god’s name was this blond even thinking of? Though the feet were only really a perk of his species, and a rather less preferable way of travel – he could still use them. He wasn’t just learning how to crawl even, a full grown man capable of carrying his own weight out of the forest – the way he was gesturing in the first place. To be fair, it isn’t really well known what direction he was going, but he did know he was distancing himself from the soft road and his vehicle further and further. 

“ What are you doing!?” A reactive move, nothing more, nothing less. Gravity was now pulling him, draping over one of the broad shoulders of this petty older brother who had legit glared death threats mere hours before. Knees may be pressed together, but legs could still move. Struggles, squirms, it’s a given, especially by someone distraught. “ Let go! P-put me down!”

Was the constant pulling of one wrist while the other formed in a fist that slammed against the ranger’s back. Is this how you handle the frightened victim and literally just fled moments ago from certain death. Oh no, he still had no idea. The mind doesn’t pick up on these certain clues. The way finger nails dug into back since pounding with fist didn’t work. How the clothing, the disguised skin that suddenly started to bead a substance that didn’t appear normal. The sharp feeling of bones and muscle that should be soft against his own waist and top of thighs. 

“ I can walk!” Those struggles did not cease, not until the blond decides to finally put him down. 

Did he listen to those pleas? Heels kicked high, trying his best to clip a chin, a neck, anything that would slow the determined path of his <span style="font-style:italic">chariot, so to speak. </span>

They grew quiet for a moment, not yet cluing what creature it was – but honestly, <span style="font-style:italic"> why. </span> Then mind drew an image of a cute little rabbit, handing over parchment like any other blue collar worker. With this in mind however, it still didn’t leave enough impact as realization sank, no. Hands instead finally went to work, grabbing flesh and digging sharp nails in – it’s hard for them to break, not that he was a vampire, but they were replaced with spines when in his other form. This time to cause more than just cat scratches. Once grounded, elbows locked to rise his body up as he tried to stiffen. Anything to deter the path of the ranger that carried him, to put him off kilter. Hell, drop the siren. “ Let go!” 

 

As for his vehicle, is the any other inspection? Any reason why it’s there – or was it written off? Had the papers scattered across the front passenger seat, among the suitcase on the floor interested a body for a quick peruse?  Was the license plate something to consider for tracing. Or did they do things entirely different on this island.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1228224804209823754"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Friday, April 12, 2024 14:06:52 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1228224804209823754">14:06:52</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-126">|| <span title="Username: zephtre

He swerved and turned to a rhythm of his own, the direction might've seemed aimless to siren, but it was with a purpose in mind. To feed. 

Scenery sped by faster and faster. The creature moved with a swiftness unlike the slow, lumbering gait the real one had. Seth wasn't exactly fast on his feet. Sonorous cracks echoed all around them. If Azarian dared glance up, they'd be met with the tree trunks *bending*. Those tall, towering behemoths, strong pillars curving like backs, as if to peer down at Azarian's misfortune. 

Down by the base, shadows peeked out. People, or atleast that was what they were vaguely shaped as. Darkness obscured any distinct details. One by one they appeared in the distance, hidden the entire time until Azarian was long past them. Forest shades? Dryadic spirits? It didn't matter. They remained rooted to the spot, witnessing yet another hapless stranger being spirited away. 

The creature paid no heed to its thrashing prey. Not even a flinch of pain or annoyance. Once Azari was in its clutches, it dropped all pretense of acting like Seth. 

Its appearance went the same way. 

From all the squirming, Azarian managed to clock it on the back of the head. An elbow clipped on the back of its head.

It *glitched*, like an old tv smacked back out of static. But instead of flipping back to the channel, it morphed. From where the Azari's elbow hit it, "Seth's" blond locks rapidly grew. They went from that mussed up and wavy texture, to sleek white. It spread throughout the entire corona, so that it now had a head much like Azarian's own. 

Its head turned more than a hundred and eighty degrees. But unlike an owl, there were no feathers to hide the strain on the neck. Skin was wrung tight like cloth. A beard grew, and skin slowly dappled blue. There was no stopping its run. 
<strong> </strong></p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1229398899576541185"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, April 15, 2024 19:52:18 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1229398899576541185">19:52:18</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-128">It was a familiar face, with an unfamiliar expression. Azarian's own father laughed open-mouthed, eyes wide and unfocused. The voice that came out was a distorted screech. It might've mimicked the patriarch's looks, but none of the mannerisms. Jerky movement rattled it. Its torso shrunk a fair bit from Seth's bulk, to Azarian's father. The creature made its head swing side to side. 

But once the pain from Azarian's nails, that made it shift rapidly again. An inhuman groan of pain ledt its lips. Eyes rolled back to bloodshot white sclera, its jaw unhinged with a click. In a split second, its mouth snapped back shut. When it did, the beard receded. The jawline was softer, more tapered. His mother, half-formed on its head while the rest of its body was lagging. The shapeshifter wasn't perfect in its ability, and to mimic. Like a five o'clock shadow remaining on the mother's face, or freckles from a sister remaining throughout. A nose gone crooked from shifting too much, unable to keep up. 

The creature kept changing through all the people its prey knew. Now a brother, next a dead sister. It taunted Azarian.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1229398979863904308"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, April 15, 2024 19:52:37 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1229398979863904308">19:52:37</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-129">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e

It’s the first thing that came to the siren’s mind when he stepped on land.  Though an open beach with minimal trees in the way, buildings erected in place – still, it was hard to see the full sky. Like the vast, and empty surroundings of the ocean bed.  Free of this rather constricting feeling. 

What never helped was the island Azarian stepped foot on. Where Mr. Lyr settled his livings situation in. A remote part of the isle itself. 

He should have listened to the elder brother. Stayed at the cottage until it was time to venture out together. That way Aurelius was a witness, and potentially the muscle that stopped the idiot who carried him from these petty situations. 

You asked for it. The constant thrashing would only hit home indefinitely. It was only time. A glitch being what it was, something unseen as eyes stared at the other’s backside, and feet. 

But only, only until long stark white hair started to grow, and lengthen in the field of view. Even as hands felt a tickle as follicles worked in overdrive – finally then he would, or <span style="font-style:italic"> might </span> understand. Of course his body would stop, giving attention as he turned to try and view the source. A head. Unhealthy. Unearthly! As if made of rubber, but the unnatural position wasn’t what spooked Azari initially. 
<img style="display:inline-flex;vertical-align:middle;width:25px;height:25px" title=":blank:" id=":blank:" src="../emojis/blank_1119673702993379348.png" alt=":blank:"></p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1232137348616028210"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Tuesday, April 23, 2024 09:13:55 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1232137348616028210">09:13:55</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-131">It was. As if a carbon copy, but not at all. Skin seemingly not worn down by natural causes, though a stern face and age appeared in as bright blue of eyes as the siren’s own. Crow feet scrunching up at the corners, while scars surfaced across lip, severing the connection of moustache as it  blended in with a thick beard. 

Cordevien. <span style="font-style:italic">  Father </span> 

No, <span style="font-style:italic"> father </span> was much informal for him, who grew grew up in a complete different environment as your typical family. Big, of course, siren’s could have many guppies per clutch, though small fraction would actually make it enough to pass into adulthood. Not that the siren even looked it, he was <span style="font-style:italic"> eighty-nine,</span> though like the rest of his brethren ( and the demands of Cordevien ), he remained forever stuck in his mid-twenties. 

Seeing his father wasn’t the issue, seeing something that wasn’t the big brother that carried him in the beginning was.  The shifter, the <span style="font-style:italic"> creature’s </span> skin would be pierced by nails that dug in <span style="font-style:italic"> harder </span> from the whole unveiling. Body would lurch itself forward, to the creature’s <span style="font-style:italic"> back, </span> desperately keeping harms way by the sudden snap of maw. 

Now his thrashing took on a more serious note. Relentless, but this time fearing not by the injuries it would cause the creature that still carried him off. Mouth opened, finally able to <strong> scream. </strong> A song of the sirens, a melodic tone of utter distress, nothing that might charm the creature that bound him – but would definitely be heard throughout a good chunk of the botanic marsh.  Pitched high, eardrum shattering, but that wasn’t the only worry of the entity.

It laughed, and laughed, and laughed. Callous, with a teetering quality to the trill. Its discordant voice was a hollow reverb in its throat, comprised of the voices of many - from those faces it stole - and thusly giving it a disquieting chorus. Cordevien's rumble melded with the tinkling melody of a sister-siren's voice, only to shift again as Seth's baritone crept in as an undertone. 

It was still rippling with cackles when Azarian took hold of its head. 

But not for long. The creature underestimated Azari. Sirens were uncommon to come by in the evergreen. This place was far too inland for them to be its natural prey. What it often ate, were weaklings. Frail humans, fae, the occasional young and naive nymph saplings. These were types to faint or freeze in sheer fear. When seen or heard, the vulnerable where often hit with a wave of debilitating shock. Shock, that Azari processed much quicker. 

It did not come across sirens - who, were tempters themselves - often. Azari's species retained some passive resistance to its entrancing effect. There was some irony in that. That those it used to taunt him with, were the very same that granted him protection through their bloodline. 

Its laughter morphed into a pained screech, rivaling the siren's own. 

Blood spurted out its eye sockets. Globs of murky black viscera oozed out, from where those claws perforated the eyes. Grots of gelatinous, translucent white slathered Azari's fingers. It had the consistency of thick sputum. 

Only then did it wrest its head away. It snapped back forward.

The beast slowed down.

Because in the next second, it hurled Azari off of it with tremendous power. And it wasn't just by monstrous strength alone. The siren would feel multiple hands grab him. Extra arms sprouted from it back, horrifically bare.  And by bare, the shifting creature simply hadn't the time to grow out skin. Palms slick with blood and mucus. Those gangly, half-formed arms displayed striated muscle, tissue, the very underpinnings of flesh and bone. 

After recklessly throwing Azari aside. The creature dropped down to all fours, hunched up in the gait of a beast. It stripped off its humane facade. Bulging out to support the new outgrowths, arms flailing akimbo, its back grew bloated. 

It bellowed out in pain. While one pair of palms smacked against its injured eyes, the other scratched at its cheek, or pawed at its scraggly hair in distress. 

Azarian was given a moment to breathe. Well, if his landing from hurtle wasn't rough at least. 

<span style="font-style:italic">Only</span> a moment. His enemy was a vindictive one.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1233067198524817440"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Thursday, April 25, 2024 22:48:49 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1233067198524817440">22:48:49</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-136">Seth burst out of the bushes. 

But instead of Azari, he came face to face with the remains of the earlier encounter. 

The abandoned vehicle, still running and warm. Around it, the mud was dried gradually, caking at the edges. Unable to engulf Azari, the bog woman sprawled by the tires. Motionless and unable to fulfill her purpose, swathes of her body sloughed off. Slowly, her rotting carcass sank with the rest of the litter. 

Seth nudged his wolf. And upon his prodding, the mutt trod closer, its snout automatically lowering to sniff at the ground. 

And then they heard it, just the faintest wisp in the wind. The echo of a scream. Seth jolted his head up. In all the years he'd been here, including the rare moments he'd seen mermaids up close, he'd never heard a creature keen like that before. Tenuous in the wind, both hauntingly airy yet abraded by fear. It bore testament to myths told of sirensongs in the mist. That scream lingered like heavy gauze, humming in the atmosphere. Ethereal, when heard above the chopping waves. But here it was foreboding, without its usual noises to temper a siren's call. 

"Hup!" he leaned down, nudging his wolf. Eyes glowing as his fingers dug into the shaggy fur. Nymph and steed turned sharply, leapt, and disappeared back into the forest. Azari's trails of distress were the scent to follow.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1233067253264547840"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Thursday, April 25, 2024 22:49:02 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1233067253264547840">22:49:02</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-137">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e

It gives hardly any options left. A retaliation, was the bog bitch really that stupid not to understand prey wouldn’t just consent to this type of treatment? Or perhaps was the siren someone different, unlike the many sentient beings this thing had consumed. 

Did they know about the sea, about what it’s waters housed in the depths? Or was it strictly an entity that preyed solely on the flesh inhabited within the thick, dense, lush of the wandering oaks. To be blatantly honest, none of this really mattered in the end. The playing field was in the monster’s favour. 

Backed in a corner, wildly stressed, but still having some sort of intelligence to <strong> not </strong> bite the thing. What if it grew a mouth somewhere and bit back? What if the thing carried poison that would surely mean the siren’s downfall. Instead he wanted to hurt it, prolonging any movement that brought it closer to it’s goal. 

And so the fingers gripped tightly as thumbs pressed in with all his might, into the gelatinous material, hopefully blinding the monster permanently. It was meant to do good damage, and the screaming in retort only solidified that Azarian did, in fact, hurt it. However, now is not that time cheers, or scream in triumph – it would never be enough to flat out kill it. Not even as sharp nails scratched toxins only to irritate, nothing fatal. 

How do you take down a beast like this? A shape shifter – what was it anyways?

Perhaps though, not in a way where the thing would just drop him as he wiggled free – no, that would be too easy. Strength, much like the kind any might inherit in times of dire need – throwing Azari as if he was the little creature from before. Had the tree not been present, he would be thrown into the lush grass. Instead, back impacted first, breaking his fall rather painfully. 

Azarian yelled, seeing as vision blurred, sprouting explosions of tiny lights. The wind knocked out of him, the consciousness still intact, but give him minute. The ground was hit next, rolling over on his side, then his belly. Did it work? He had no time to look. Only to weakly claw at the earth as feet kicked to propel him forward in a meager crawl. Anything to distance himself from the beast that was only temporarily distracted. 

<span style="font-style:italic"> Move, gotta move.. feet, don’t fail me now. </span> 

The motivation was not dying here. Not like this. Would he even be found?  Knees bent in a way to give feet grip, pushing himself up to try and bend over in such a stance, beginning to limp himself away as fast as he could.  Just like the movies, absolutely like the stupid slasher movies .. even adding on more of the unoriginal characteristics of a soon-to-be victim, yelling at the top of his lungs.

Had they travelled far from the car ?

It reacted by swiveling its head around and screaming back. Guttural bellows that came out were no longer recognizable as human. Resounding tremors tore through the air, setting everything in a heart-stopping rumble. The lament began with its back hunched over. But as it screeched, it raised its head up to direct it towards the terrified siren. The original, main set of hands pawing at its injury pulled away to reveal the damage.

It had a face like no other.

Congealed blood crusted hollowed out eye sockets. Where Azari crushed the viscera, the gunk of remnant eye matter oozed out. 

The monster could retain no semblance of a singular face. It was all a horrific pastiche of something half-formed, something not quite uniform in appearance. Swathes of hair, fur and scale grew in random unorganized patches. Half of its countenance was male, while the other half clearly female. Deep grooves lined the sides of its mouth, marionette lines that highlighted unnaturally elastic texture of its skin. Flabs of skin pooled in layers, like it were a wax sculpture melting off in stages.

More aberrations sprouted besides the mass of wriggling arms on its back. A third leg sprouted from the hip, limp and useless at such an unnatural angle, coated in a slick of blood like a newborn babe. Bones jutted out from freshly made punctures, bursting from within its mangled body. 

As the scream died down, its maw remained slack-jawed. It panted like a beast of burden. And out of that unfurled the disgusting flap of flesh called its tongue. And in the very center of it was a newly formed eye, jerking in a spastic, nystagmic motion.

Right as a weakened Azari tried to limp away, the  creature reared on its hind legs. And then it lunged. This was the end for Azarian.

But another voice joined it. Inhuman as well, though familiar. Canine. A growling, throaty snarl mingled in. Thud from the impact exploded by Azari's feet. The direwolf's sheer weight pummeled into it, causing both it and its prey to tumble past the siren in a blur. 

The wolf's rider wasn't on the saddle. They'd dismounted just moments before the wolf was sicced on.

Searing pain sliced through Azari's calf. Not too deep, but not shallow either. Those jagged bone spurs sticking out of the beast's body grazed them. 

A <span style="font-style:italic">whooshing</span> noise sliced through the air. That gusty weight preceded a more concrete sensation - that of the heavy coil that snapped around Azari's waist. A whip shot out from the shadowy edges. It only wrapped twice, firm and magically cinched to conform to the target it was willed to ensnare. The leather braids seemed to curl in on their own.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1245833720405954694"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Friday, May 31, 2024 04:18:25 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1245833720405954694">04:18:25</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-143">Seth grunted as he yanked. That one forceful tug was enough to reel Azari into his arms, catching them if they lost balance.

"You're okay," he hollered, both in a poor attempt to assuage as well but laced with a suspicious tone of disbelief, "Did you get bit?"</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1245833787242446910"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Friday, May 31, 2024 04:18:41 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1245833787242446910">04:18:41</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-144">|| <span title="Username: v.a.l.k.i.e
